# Foreword by the Executive Director

2024 marks the  $20^{\text{th}}$  anniversary of the creation of the European Union Agency for

Railways. Since its foundation, ERA has been at the side of the European railway stakeholders, carrying out an ever-increasing set of crucial tasks for railways. I am proud of all the achievements the Agency has accomplished during the last 20 years and I am confident the Agency will bring even more added value to the railway sector in the future, especially with the progressive development of the Single European Railways Area.

In the recent years, we have witnessed many worrying trends, such as the resurgence of war on the European continent, certain macroeconomic challenges, as well as increasingly serious climate change impacts across the world. In such worrying environment, transport has a crucial role to play, not only in ensuring the safe transport of people and goods, but as well in the decarbonisation of the sector and its adaptability to a changing climate. Safety is also a crucial element for railways. Following the tragic rail accident which took place in February 2023 near Larissa in Greece, we need to ensure that the right measures and checks are put in place to prevent such accidents from happening again. "A sustainable, safe European transport system without frontiers" does therefore not only represent our Agency's vision statement, but also reflects the ambition of the rail sector at large.

In line with its mandate, the European Union Agency for Railways aims at covering a wide range of areas of work, involving actions to drive the continuation of the progress with railway safety and interoperability, together with its role of EU-wide authority for Vehicle Authorisation, Single Safety Certification, and ERTMS Trackside Approval.

The multi-annual work programme 2024-2026, together with the annual programme 2024 have been planned and prepared following the principles of the intervention logic. In addition, the work programme was prepared reflecting the conclusions of the SPD 2024 Workshop held with the Management Board in June 2022.

The year 2024 will be an important milestone for our Authority activities, as also it marks the fifth year since the start of the Agency's Authority activities according to the technical pillar of the  $4^{\text{th}}$  Railway Package. The Agency has now gained significant experience in running the tasks related to its Authority role, as well as in forecasting their volume to the best extent possible, considering the challenges of a moving macroeconomic context. However, the volatility of the applications and their volumes can still greatly differ from one year to the other, which renders the planning of activities and the detailed forecast of revenues somewhat complex. The Agency will continue to monitor this aspect closely and to apply its agile management of these tasks. In addition, it is important to note that the Agency has reached an increasingly higher maturity level with the processing of authorisation and certification tasks, which provides for a higher efficiency in their delivery.

The Agency will also continue to reinforce its efficiency and effectiveness for this multiannual work programme. In 2022 already, the Agency's Management Board adopted the Strengthening Plan and its subsequent action plan prepared by the Agency in close cooperation with the European Commission, highlighting the critical importance of areas of works such as: TSIs and national rules clean up, ERTMS, CSM ASLP, the monitoring of NSAs and NoBos, as well as data and digitalization. As a result, the Agency received an increase of 12 temporary agent posts (TAs) starting in 2023, which should be entirely covered through the Agency's existing stream of revenues. The latter represents a significant challenge, especially in the context of a volatile pattern of inflation. Continuously, the Agency is making a thorough assessment of its capacity to cover these costs in a

sustainable manner until the end of MFF 2021-2027. Additionally, the Agency is making sustained efforts for a combined response to the resourcing challenge by increasing the direct utilisation of its resources, both in terms of budget and FTEs.

The Agency keeps a strong commitment to deploying the necessary resources to meet the legal deadlines related to issuing of VA, SSC and ERTMS Trackside approvals, while also respecting the deadlines for its safety and interoperability related activities, all of which contribute to the achievement of the high-level policy objectives of the 4th Railway Package. The decision time linked to the authority tasks has undeniably a tremendous impact on the rail stakeholders and on the competitiveness of rail compared with other sectors. The Agency therefore strives for an increasingly higher level of efficiency in its authority tasks, as for its other activities.

The Agency has based the 2024 budget envelope on the draft budget proposal of the European Commission and is hopeful that this envelope will be confirmed as the final result of the EU budget negotiation procedure for 2024. Any cut applied to this envelope would affect the level of ambition and commitment for the proposed activities in 2024.

The Agency would also like to bring forward interesting and new projects that could benefit the entire rail sector. Separately to the Single Programming Document, the Agency has put forward a proposal on its resource needs to develop the Information Sharing System (ISS), which is crucial for the successful implementation of CSM ASLP. The Agency will continue to work intensely on its NSA monitoring activities, as it is one of the policy priorities highlighted in the Strengthening Action Plan. In addition, there is a need to develop, together with Member States, a new Priority Countries Programme (PCP) at EU level, with a broader approach which goes beyond the scope of current monitoring activities of the Agency (e.g. NSA, NoBo, Peer review NIB, etc). The PCP has the potential to provide a more holistic picture of railway safety and interoperability in the Member States, and to bring further changes to improve safety across the EU through capacity building and mutual exchanges. These tasks would need to receive an additional dedicated resource envelope. The legal framework (current and any potential new evolution) is to be defined.

I would like to assure the members of the Management Board that the Agency will continue to implement the mechanism already put in place for a regular monitoring of the SPD implementation in terms of outputs delivery and resource consumption, as well as of the Strengthening Action Plan. The Agency will also continue to improve the set of budget execution monitoring actions already established to make best use of the available budget appropriations. The Agency will strengthen its tools to better plan, monitor, and report so as to continuously increase its data-driven, transparent working culture. In addition, more efforts will be produced to achieve more with less resources, as well as ensuring that the processes within the Agency are streamlined to deliver high-quality results to all our stakeholders, in line with the Strengthening Action Plan 2023-2027.

The Agency will also continue to work closely with its stakeholders in order to ensure the successful implementation of this challenging multi-annual programme. These activities of the Agency are crucial for contributing to the achievement of a significant modal shift to rail, in particular by helping to create and manage a Single European Rail Area, and to continuously improve railway safety in Europe. At the same time, we will continue our efforts to progress towards a culture of collaboration in the Agency. I would like to thank the ERA staff and all our stakeholders for their dedication and support, that I am sure will continue for the years to come, as we will work towards an improved European transport system, multimodal in nature, with rail as its backbone, eventually benefitting from a fully functioning Single European Railway Area.

# Mission statement

The vision and mission statements of the Agency ("A sustainable, safe European transport system without frontiers" and "Moving Europe towards a sustainable and safe railway system without frontiers", respectively) were defined in 2021. They reflect its current position and role, while of course remaining fully in line with the legal mandate of the Agency.

The Agency contributes to the further development and effective functioning of a Single European Railway Area without frontiers, by guaranteeing a high level of railway safety and interoperability, while improving the competitive position of the railway sector, as envisaged by the Agency Regulation 2016/796. In particular, the Agency shall contribute, on technical matters, to the implementation of Union legislation by developing a common approach to safety on the Union rail system and by enhancing the level of interoperability on the Union rail system and associated data, with a specific focus on facilitating the interoperable deployment of ERTMS and on access to data for pushing rail modernisation and digitalisation. By working in close cooperation with the national authorities acting in the fields of railway safety and interoperability, the Agency will substantially contribute to an increased competitiveness of rail and to the seamless cross-border traffic in the EU. Moreover, through timely delivery of appropriate regulation that reflects the harmonised and validated solution proposals from the Europe's Rail Joint Undertaking, the Agency contributes significantly to the coordinated and rapid deployment of such solutions, thus strengthening the competitiveness of rail in the transport mix. All these elements are translated into rail becoming more attractive and affordable for passengers and freight, with the Agency playing an active role in supporting the delivery of the European Green Deal for the EU citizens and businesses.

Through its mission and actions, the Agency is committed to contribute to the EC Political guidelines:

a European Green Deal  
an economy that works for people  
a Europe fit for the digital age  
a stronger Europe in the world

The Agency will support the EC agenda to ensure sustainable, safe, affordable, and accessible transport and to strengthen railways' role in the transport mix, in line with its mission and mandate.

# I. General context

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/bb2a3678-2269-46fc-8476-7b93d062ab0f/82530684a834e7abe31c7d32dbb7243b093f367eed7434ebdf8bc9a89292faea.jpg)

Transport is an essential part of the European integration, especially given its contribution to the functioning of the free movement of services, goods, and people. Transport also represents around  $9\%$  of the EU gross added value and directly employs around 11 million workers (1), therefore representing an important sector for society at large. EU transport policies have been developed according to the key principles of safety, sustainability, resilience, connectivity, and efficiency.

Through its long-term vision for the transport sector and European society, the European Commission published in 2020 the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy with a detailed action plan of 82 initiatives. With this strategy, the Commission presents how the EU transport system will achieve its needed green and digital transformation and become more resilient. As outlined in the European Green Deal, the result will be a  $90\%$  cut in carbon emissions by 2050. Regarding the rail sector, the following targets have been set:

Traffic on high-speed rail will double by 2030  
Rail freight traffic will increase by  $50\%$  by 2030 and double by 2050  
By 2030, rail and waterborne-based intermodal transport will be able to compete on equal footing with road-only transport in the EU

The European Union Agency for Railways will support the European Commission, in line with its accountability ceiling, in achieving these goals, in particular through the further development and effective functioning of a Single European Railway Area without frontiers.

The 2024-2026 programming period for the Agency involves two different types of activities:

The policy tasks contributing to the implementation of Union legislation by developing a common approach to safety on the Union rail system and by enhancing the level of interoperability on the Union rail system, taking into account the policy priorities identified in the Strengthening Plan and implemented through the Strengthening Action Plan 2023-2027.  
The fully fledged performance of the Agency's tasks as EU-wide authority for safety certification, vehicle authorisation and ERTMS trackside approval, along with other tasks in the field of railway safety and interoperability as foreseen in the Technical Pillar of the Fourth Railway Package.

The Agency continues to implement its work programme following the principles of the intervention logic, in line with the guidelines provided by the Network of EU Agencies. The intervention logic supports the Agency by emphasising the desired changes and the road to its achievement. It is also a thinking process supporting the Agency to design, reconsider, and adapt its outputs to the most effective one for a determined outcome.

The Agency also strives to increase its efficiency in delivering the outcomes and impacts expected by EU citizens. In light of the above, the work programme of the Agency (in its multi-annual and annual planning) is organised around seven strategic statements, which project the Agency's role in relation to its stakeholders, complemented by two transversal strategic statements, which capture the Agency's governance and support functions. These strategic statements have been in place since the adoption of SPD 2022-2024 and are extremely important, as they show the direction of travel on which the Agency plans to embark in order to make railways work better for society, subject of course to its remit and accountability ceiling. The concrete Agency work, represented by projects and services with concrete outputs, is organised by grouping the projects and services which together can contribute to the outcomes and impacts stated in a particular strategic statement.

In addition, SPD 2024-2026 will follow and align itself with the actions and resource allocations detailed in the Strengthening Action Plan adopted by the MB in November 2022. The seven priority areas will be highlighted in the annual section and their importance

will be reflected both in terms of FTE and budget allocation. Of course, the Agency will remain flexible and redeploy resources if needed but this innovative approach provides a roadmap for all stakeholders regarding the areas on which the Agency will focus in the coming years.

Thanks to a joint effort with the European Commission and the support from the Management Board, the Agency was granted 12 additional TAs to its establishment plan to implement the Strengthening Plan. However, these additional resources must be financed within the existing budget envelope, with no additional subsidy allocation, which creates a budgetary pressure on the Agency. The Agency proposes in SPD 2024-2026 a robust budget allocation, which copes with this pressure and provides resources for different essential activities. However, the budget is based on the assumption that the EC draft budget proposal will be confirmed at the end of the EU budget negotiation cycle. Any cut applied to this envelope would jeopardize the basic business continuity for the Agency's functions and will affect the level of ambition and commitment for the proposed activities in 2024.

The Agency will pay significant attention to a regular monitoring of the SPD implementation in terms of outputs, resource consumption and revenues, which can allow for agile responses and possible adaptation of its work programme. The Agency will continue to work together with the pool of experts for the mutual benefit of the cooperation between the Agency and the NSAs. This cooperation may also help the Agency to tackle capacity shortages, as well as language skills gaps. In addition, the Agency will strive for continuously improving its efficiency in delivering the expected outputs, as well as its overall performance in contributing to the expected outcomes and impacts.

# II. Multi-annual programming 2024-2026

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/bb2a3678-2269-46fc-8476-7b93d062ab0f/676516dc25dcc2914479767ffdef5a37f83281ca034c5c13b1bdf081499f8c81.jpg)

# Structure of the multi-annual programme 2024-2026

The structure of the Agency's multi-annual work programme is organised according to 9 strategic statements:

Strategic Statement 1 - There will no longer be any technical and operational barriers to the free movement of people and goods by rail, assets can be reused throughout Europe.  
Strategic Statement 2 - Rail will become the backbone that supports an environmentally sustainable multimodal transport system and will be favoured as a transport mode by the new generations.  
Strategic Statement 3 - Rail traffic will become seamless and MaaS (Mobility as a Service) and LaaS (Logistic as a Service) will be ensured, including multi-leg ticketing.  
Strategic Statement 4 - Rail will be an increasingly safe and secure mode of transport for its users and workers.  
Strategic Statement 5 - Rail will be resilient and agile in responding to emergency situations.  
Strategic Statement 6 - Rail will become increasingly economically competitive as a mode and as a sector.  
Strategic Statement 7 - The EU will become the global reference for rail and ERA authorisations will be globally recognised.  
Strategic Statement 8 – The Agency will ensure an effective and efficient governance of its portfolio of activities in order to offer the best value for money to citizens and business in the EU  
Strategic Statement 9 - The Agency will ensure a performant working environment, based on high quality motivated resources and a collaborative behaviour.

Following guidance from the EU Agencies' network on the SPD, the Agency proposed for SPD 2023-2025 to use the intervention logic on these strategic statements to identify impact and outcomes. With SPD 2024-2026, the Agency proposes to look at a new concept: intermediate outcome. Given that outcomes are quite difficult to influence directly from outputs, the concept of intermediate outcomes is interesting given its more direct link with the Agency and its influence on outcomes.

The Agency has therefore started to develop intermediate outcomes in each strategic statement. For intermediate outcomes, a set of common interventions was defined by the Agency:

# Knowledge sharing

ERA shares knowledge with the sector (i.e. training, reports, etc)

These types of interventions will help structure the multiannual work programme and assess where additional work is most needed to achieve the desired outcomes. The multiannual section will also reflect the results of the MB workshop on SPD 2024-2026 which took place in June 2022.

In addition, it should be noted that the arbitration exercise for the year 2024 was further developed and intensified. Indeed, it followed the key principles and areas of priorities detailed in the Strengthening Action Plan. In addition, the Agency prioritised through the identification of the anticipated added value of activities, as well as their potential contribution towards the desired outcomes. The Agency followed a data-driven approach, looking at previous year's resource consumption, as well as the deliverables description for each project / service.

# Content of the multi-annual programme 2024-2026

For its 2024-2026 work programme, the Agency considers the possible ways of balancing the demand for its authority work on one hand and the ambition level for the priority areas detailed in the Strengthening Plan, on the other hand. The authorisations, certificates and approvals issued by the Agency have a direct impact on the functioning of the rail sector and bring much added value in terms of safety and interoperability.

Furthermore, subject to additional resources, the Agency intends to implement, together with Member States, a Priority Country Programme (PCP) which is a strategic initiative that aims to assess and monitor the state of railway safety and interoperability legislation implementation in Member States providing a comprehensive picture of railway safety and helping the MS to identify areas for improvement.

The focus of this programme will be on the legal set-up and the capability of the organisations within the Member States to take up the various responsibilities under railway safety and interoperability legislation, both at authority as well as operational level. Furthermore, also the Member State responsibility under EU legislation will be in the scope of the assessments.

In this perspective, the Agency has additionally developed a robust business case for the development of a supporting Information Sharing System (ISS) demonstrating the expected benefits, clarifying the additional resources needed to develop, deploy, and maintain the ISS as an IT solution and providing a detailed timetable for implementation spanning from 2024 to 2029. The objective of the ISS initiative is to improve railway safety in the European Union through the sharing and analysis of relevant safety information, supported by a pro-active, performing and technology-proof system of data exchange.

In addition, the strategic role in policy development, research and innovation, and advice provided by the Agency is recognised as highly important and should continue to be strengthened. The cooperation with the Europe's Rail Joint Undertaking is a strategic long-term activity aimed at ensuring alignment between the EU regulatory framework on railways and efficient EU funding of rail research. Furthermore, this will continue paving the way for the inclusion of new technologies in the TSIs and, pending their adoption, in technical opinions of the Agency. It is equally important to highlight the possible role of the Agency to monitor and support the adequate implementation of the existing legal

framework through a harmonised level of maturity both at the levels of operators and national authorities. To make its operations always more efficient and effective, the Agency will continue to implement to its full extent the continuous improvement approach to its project management and make sure that its resources are deployed in those activities where it can have the highest impact and added value for the railway sector and the EU citizens. The Agency will also continue to develop its workstream on cybersecurity and will liaise with ENISA to explore future scope for cooperation. Following the cybersecurity regulation, the Agency will need to increase its resources spent on this item, which is reflected in the Annual Work Programme.

The breakdown of FTE and budget distribution by Strategic Statement over the 2023-2026 period are shown in the following charts.

In the field of Railway Interoperability, the Agency has identified so far six intermediate outcomes that it can actively influence through its portfolio of TSIs, ERTMS, National rules, and Registers services. They are essential components, which will lead to the achievement of the strategic statement. The already identified intermediate outcomes are as follows:

1. ERTMS is fully implemented on rolling stock by all Railway Undertakings  
2. ERTMS is fully implemented on railway infrastructure by all Infrastructure Managers  
3. All railway rolling stock is TSI compliant by all RUs across the EU. (exc. TAP/TAF & OPE)  
4. All railway infrastructure is TSI compliant by all IMs across the EU  
5. National rules (rolling stock & fixed installation) are harmonised across the EU  
6. All relevant railway-related data is shared in an open and transparent way so that it is utilisable and useful for the sector

Of course, this list will continue to evolve in the future to include additional intermediate outcomes, as the Agency continues to pursue its full implementation of the intervention logic.

Following the results of the MB workshop in June 2022 on SPD 2024-2026, where the Management Board expressed its desire for the Agency to propose more knowledge sharing activities, such as training, and other dissemination activities, the Agency will strengthen its activities in this domain. Such activities will be coordinated by the ERA Academy, being the established knowledge sharing vehicle of the Agency. While being part of Strategic Statement 7, the ERA Academy activities, by their nature, serve all strategic statements of the Agency.

The Agency will also continue to deliver on its role as sole body responsible for issuing multi-Member-State authorisations, certifications, and approvals. The Agency will continue performing its tasks in full partnership with the NSAs. In addition, the links between authorisation, certifications, and approvals by the Agency and the supervision by the NSAs will be strengthened. The Agency will also continue to drive further the harmonisation towards the Single European Railway Area, ensuring the path towards technical and operational interoperability. The advancement of the System Pillar and the Agency's inputs in the matter will further support harmonisation.

The lessons learnt through the issuing of VAs, ERTMS trackside approvals and from the monitoring of NoBos will be used to capture continuous improvement opportunities for the technical specifications and to the authorization procedures. The experience in issuing safety certificates will be used to better steer the safety related policy making, so railway safety will never be misused again as a barrier. More specifically, the work on NoBo monitoring will be reinforced in 2024, with additional resources dedicated to this activity, in line with the direction given in the Strengthening Plan.

The stability of the TSIs, together with a successful cleaning up of the remaining national rules are the foundation of seamless operations across Europe and for an increasingly effective authority function, reinforcing the added value of a European mindset in the EU railway system. In 2024, the Agency will continue to work on the cleaning-up of national technical and safety rules, as well as those on fixed installation and ERTMS. This cleaning-up is an important step towards delivering a truly harmonised EU rail system. The Agency will continue to focus on the removal of redundant national rules (operational and technical), the harmonisation of the remaining rules and the development of AMOCs.

In 2023, the Agency has finalised the cleaning up of the national rules for vehicles. The Agency has further identified the national rules that should be transferred into the TSIs by means of further harmonisation, specific cases and closing of open points. This transfer will take place as of 2024 by means of Change Requests and will result in a significant reduction of the national rules.

Strategic Statement 1

There will no longer be any technical and operational barriers to the free movement of people and goods by rail, assets can be reused throughout Europe.

- Close  $33\%$  of the change requests following the national technical rules which led to their inclusion in TSIs;  
Continue to assess NSR set-up in Member States.

When it comes to dissemination, the Agency agreed on a communication plan for the TSIs implementation. This plan consists of a Q&A set of information, available on the ERA website, the follow-up of the webinars already performed in 2023 and workshops. The Agency plans to organise 4 workshops in 2024.

As part of the next TSI revision, the Agency will work for reducing further the existing specific cases of Member States on top of the harmonised technical specification contained in TSI. Even if the transfer of the cleaned national rule into the TSIs will lead to potential increase of new specific cases, the Agency's priority remains to work on EU harmonisation of checks and tests. By end 2024, the Agency will deliver an impact assessment on the TSI specific cases and their temporary duration.

As part of the maintenance of the National Rules, the Agency will support the Member States in the review of their National Rules against the new requirements of the TSI Package 2023. In 2024 the Agency will introduce a CCM process that will control the addition of new National Specific Parameters (NSPs). In parallel we will seek to establish the complete list of current NSPs, use best efforts to start the clean-up/Validation of current NSPs and propose a timeline for cleaning the list that matches the resourcing and priorities of the Agency work programme.

Of course, seamless operations also mean exchanging data, a process on which the Agency will continue to contribute by facilitating the data exchange for, among various purposes, authorization, registration, and route compatibility checks, based on the linked data approach. The Agency acknowledges the clear, shared ambition to drive the development of the digital agenda and in 2024 will implement in full the requirements set out in the recent RINF regulation amendments, including the application guide that will support the implementation on the ground. In parallel the Agency is working on the proof of concept for a digital route book and in particular identifying the supporting infrastructure data needed for route books. The ISS tool to support the implementation of the CSM ASLP regulation will be built on the extension of the ERA Ontology. Whilst the funding to develop the application layer has not yet been secured the Agency is preparing the development of the Ontology for agreement in early 2024. The announced evolution of the Telematics TSIs is recognised as is the financial support of the Commission for this work. The work however is contingent on successful procurement in 2024 and in the absence of the required internal resources must be considered at risk, at least until the successful outcome of the procurement has been secured.

The Agency will also assess mature innovation products, with a clear potential for market uptake. In this context, the Agency will focus on exploring emerging needs such as:

Better coordination of traffic management EU-wide, including, but not limited to, planning, capacity management, and emergency responses  
■ Increased and improved offer for passengers and freight in the railway sector  
Improved operations through the adoption of automatic translation systems and training for operators in their native language. This would enhance the railway system's resilience to interoperability issues and increase cross-border traffic.

The objective is to make the railway system more resilient to interoperability issues and increase the cross-border traffic.

When it comes to ERTMS, after the publication of the CCS TSI 2023/1695 including the new set of ERTMS specifications (being ETCS Baseline 4 Release 1, RMR GSM-R Baseline 1 Maintenance Release 1 + FRMCS Baseline 0; ATO Baseline 1 Release 1), the focus for 2024-2026 will be on the implementation of the new CCS framework. In addition, a further harmonisation through TSIs will focus on telematics, security aspects, national rules harmonisation and innovations such as new materials, new on-board sources of energy

based on the results provided through the System Pillar work. A CCS TSI amendment will be required which mainly addresses the SUBSET-153 and the necessary testing specifications (SUBSET-076 for ETCS and SUBSET-151 for ATO). In addition, there will be a technical opinion providing the delivery of the FRMCSV2 specifications. A CCS TSI application guide will be drafted with the focus on the changes in the CCS TSI implementation framework, in particular the new transition and migration schemes included in the CCS TSI. In order to apply the specifications maintenance framework, the Agency will deliver an ERTMS Baseline Compatibility Analysis report which includes the answers of the ERA questionnaires.

The service 'Management of Innovation and long-term evolution of the Agency' will continue to steer the research & innovation policy of the Agency and its future development. It will also be in charge of coordinating the Agency's input to the work on the System Pillar. The Agency will ensure technical assistance to the Commission, as guardian of interoperability and safety, and as system authority for ERTMS & telematics. This will boost harmonisation of operations, subsystems, and components, leaving the practical aspects to the industry, assuming an appropriate level of oversight. The Agency will continue to identify related research needs and assess mature innovation products, with a clear potential for market uptake, in order to reflect them into the technical specifications.

# Strategic Statement 2 & 3

2 Rail will become the backbone that supports an environmentally sustainable multimodal transport system and will be favoured as a transport mode by the new generation

3 Rail traffic will become seamless and MaaS (Mobility as a Service) and LaaS (Logistic as a Service) will be ensured, including multi-leg ticketing

The Agency is playing a pivotal role in supporting the transformation of the European transport system towards decarbonised, interoperable, and safe transport modes based on multi-modal integration (MaaS).

In 2023, the Agency played a key role for driving the data and digitalisation agenda for railways, based on the linked data pilots and the revision of TAP/TAF TSI. Those elements are particularly relevant in a multi-modal context as they enable that integration in terms of ticketing and timetables which has been preventing the effective development of rail as the backbone of a multi-modal and international transport.

The Agency has identified for this Strategic Statement two intermediate outcomes, which will support the achievement of the overarching statement. There are the following ones:

1. TAP is implemented by all relevant railway actors (IMs, RUs, ticket vendors), it is actually used as the main channel of information exchange and the ticketing is integrated in the multimodal environment with other transport modes  
2. TAF is implemented by all relevant railway actors (IMs, RUs, WKs, CTOs) and it is actually used as the main channel of information exchange

Of course, TAF and TAP TSI will also be in scope for some intermediate outcomes already identified under strategic statement 1. Additional intermediate outcomes will be identified in the future to further implement the intervention logic within the Agency.

For the period 2024-2026, the Agency will still be a top player in ensuring the right framework for the data and information exchange related to assets and services (including ticketing data), based on linked data, universal data identifiers and more and better data exchanged between operators and customers. This will ensure a seamless exchange of data with other modes of transport, thus allowing the customers to benefit from a comprehensive logistics chain or the mobility-as-a-service, respectively.

While specifications for infrastructure description related data used in the register of infrastructure (RINF), respectively for information exchange in telematics applications, were developed for different purposes, they now appear to be inconsistent between one another in the context of their integration into the European Mobility Data Space (EMDS) for which the ERA Vocabulary has been set as building block for rail. Corresponding alignment and linking of rail data for infrastructure description constitutes both an internal and external challenge for the Agency that will be addressed through the work of the Agency on the review of the governance of location coding in the context of the review of TSIs on telematics applications and development of the RINF Regulation and associated RINF application.

Moreover, the Agency is a publisher in the open data portal, with 13 datasets published. Currently, the Agency is developing the strategic direction for linked data under strategic statement 8, while exploring the mainstreaming of this approach to other registers and databases. Once moved from a strategic development concept to a mainstreamed approach, this stream of work will be covered under strategic statement 2 and 3. In addition, the TAF TSI will provide the data communication requirements for the transparent and efficient traffic management and train operations system of the future including also (i) first and last mile logistic segments involving intermodal actors (operators, terminals) and (ii) linkage to other modes of transport (road, waterborne). This will also contain the enhanced simple and smart tracking of trains, wagons and consignments. The same TSI will also include additional requirements for the setting up of LaaS starting from consignment order (intermodal compliant), train operation preparation and ending in well-predicted / efficient delivery of trains, wagons and consignments to the business partners.

Concerning the environmental sustainability of the railway system, the Agency will continue to deliver support and assistance to the EC on rail and sustainability with annual topical reports, as well as for the coordination of transport of dangerous goods by rail, recognising of course the supporting essence of the Agency's role in the matter.

# Strategic Statement 4

Rail will be an increasingly safe and secure mode of transport for its users and workers

In the field of Railway Safety, the Agency has identified 3 categories of intermediate outcomes that it can actively influence through its portfolio of safety related projects and services and that are essential pre-conditions to achieve the strategic statement 4. The identified intermediate outcomes are as follows:

1. All railway operators – IM, RU, ECM – understand and accept their responsibility and actively implement an SMS to control the risks of operational activities;  
2. An increased performance of and trust in the different safety related control levels in the system - ERA, MS, NSA, ASBO, ECM CB, accreditation, recognition, NIB;  
3. Safety and safety management/performance related data is shared in an open and transparent way;

Up until now the Agency has invested most of its efforts in building knowledge and regulating, while not sufficiently supporting the railway sector in the actual implementation of the legislative framework. The following years of the Agency's work programme will focus more on the actual implementation by supporting the sector through knowledge sharing, by better understanding the issues the sector is facing when implementing the legislative framework, by reinforcing the expected outcome where possible and enforcing it where necessary. Within this framework of intermediate outcomes and interventions for statement 4 the Agency will continue to focus on:

1. Supporting Member States in developing, adopting and repealing national legislation and strengthening NSAs' and NIBs' capacity, in line with principles and legal acts promoted by the EU. (sharing knowledge/ monitoring/ reinforcing)  
2. Enhancing railway safety through positive safety culture and integration of human and organisational factors and on the harmonisation of the safety approach, partly through SSC applications. (sharing knowledge/ monitoring/reinforcing)  
3. Monitoring of NSAs and the follow-up of issues emerged during the  $1^{\text{st}}$  cycle of audits (monitoring / reinforcing). By the end of the 2nd cycle, reflection as to whether changes to the current framework are needed will be made and appropriate proposals to the MB will be put forward in 2025.  
4. Learning lessons through the issuing of SSCs, the monitoring of NSAs, the review of NIB accident investigation reports and the information exchanged during NSA and NIB meetings and meetings organised with the AsBos, this will be used to continuously improve the common safety methods, as well as the safety certification procedures (knowledge building/ sharing knowledge / monitoring)  
5. Strengthening the culture of risk management to identify risks and mitigating measures but also opportunities to improve the efficiency of operations preserving the safety level. This shall cover well-known operational scenarios, including interfaces with other transport modes, and the adoption of emerging technology and related relevant risks (e.g. cyber security, etc.). (knowledge building/ sharing knowledge)  
6. Improving the structure, quality, and availability of safety relevant data while making sure it is shared in an open and transparent way among all railway actors. (knowledge building/ monitoring).

The Agency will endeavour to make sure that the rules and system specifications are smart, proportionate and contribute to the competitiveness of the industry. It will also make sure that the SSC, VA, and ERTMS TA processes are cost and time efficient, fostering the entrance of new operators in the market.

As presented in previous strategic statements, the agency aims at evaluating the economic impact of the vehicle authorisation and issuing of single safety certificate processes on the railway sector, the impact of the TSIs as a package, of market opening and competition and of modular interchangeability in the ERTMS system specifications. The Agency will assess interoperability and safety improvements from a cost-effectiveness perspective, also considering efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's internal processes. The results of the assessments will be used to propose recommendations for improving the legal texts, as well as any non-regulatory instruments, in the spirit of the Better Regulation principles. Building on the IA work in the past years, particular attention will be given within the ESG on evaluating the IA practice and stakeholder feedback on the IAs. In addition, the Management Board, NSA and NRB networks will be regularly informed about the return of experience, lessons learnt and priorities for the IA practice. Furthermore, the important work on women in transport, which should lead to the strengthening of women's employment and equal opportunities for women and men in the transport sector will be pursued. Indeed, many studies have shown that gender parity in the workforce increases the productivity and the cohesion of staff. In addition, gender parity increases diversity of views, which in itself brings innovative solutions.

Strategic Statement 6

Rail will become increasingly economically competitive as a mode and as a sector

# Strategic Statement 7

The EU will become the global reference for rail and ERA authorisations will be globally recognised

One of the objectives of the Agency is to become a global reference in the railway domain for technical matters and build its reputation of a solid, resilient, and trustworthy organization. To achieve that, the Agency will work on multiple fronts. It will support the EC in designing, implementing, and monitoring the EU transport foreign policy. The Agency will also contribute to international standardization by strengthening its cooperation with European and international standardization organizations. The Agency will also prepare dissemination contents and organise training sessions and other means of sharing the precious knowledge it has gathered. Furthermore, the Agency will focus on the EC priorities in terms of technical and geographical areas and will also provide the requested analyses and support. When it comes to its international workstream, the Agency will focus its international activities on the basis of broader strategic considerations and following general approaches.

Focussing on training and dissemination, in 2024-2026, the Agency will continue to strengthen its dissemination capabilities and tools, reflecting there the results of the MB workshop on SPD 2024-2026. In addition, the Agency will propose a range of webinars on a variety of topics under the expertise of the Agency and will continue to organise EU-wide railway events.

Finally, the Agency will continue supporting the NSA, NIB and NRB Networks and facilitating interfaces between them, the European Commission, and the Agency where appropriate.

In order to achieve the strategic statement 8, the Agency has identified six intermediate outcomes that it will actively work towards in the following years through the related portfolio of projects and services:

1. Digitalisation of the Agency (as strategic preparation work)

Single source of data for internal access  
Single source of data for external access  
Data is only introduced once  
Data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable & Reusable)

2. Staff understand the mission and vision of the Agency, internalise it and have the flexibility, the ownership/ autonomy with their activities, and a clear mutual understanding of their roles and responsibilities to actively contribute to the strategic direction of the Agency  
3. The Agency has a sound and agile governance framework, whose processes and administration favour clarity, efficiency and decision making at the right level.  
4. The SPD process steers the Agency's strategy and multi-annual work programme development in an integrated, evidence-based, and coordinated manner as well as the monitoring of its effectiveness. This can be achieved through interfacing with the internal stakeholders owning the strategies and the external stakeholders (EC, EB strategic calendar, etc).  
5. SPD is the single reference (for internal and external stakeholders) for all critical tactical information providing the overarching view on the implementation of the projects and services.  
6. The Agency is a learning, ethical, legally complying organisation where the decision-making, the strong financial control, the monitoring and reporting processes give the ED the assurance of best value for money.

As far as the digitalisation aspect is concerned, the Agency has acknowledged its importance to ensure a sustainable development of railways in Europe as a competitive mode of transport and has the ambition to become a reference for facilitating the multi-modal data exchange and queries, based on the data-centric architecture and the linked data technology. The Agency aims at exploiting the potential of digitalization of the sector to the largest extent in its operations and administration. The I&T strategy and the interoperable data roadmap will boost the performance level of internal processes and will allow to have modern systems such as OSS, Registers, etc. fully functioning according to schedule and completely interoperable with commercial software solutions currently adopted by the railway industry to support the operators in their daily business.

The other intermediate outcomes will be achieved also through the optimization of the ERA planning, monitoring and reporting capabilities, to enhance the Agency's programme, project, and service management framework together with the Single Programming Document and the Consolidated Annual Activity Report. This will lead to an allocation of resources based on impact and intended outcome, fostering the added value created for the railway sector and an overall better performance of the Agency. An Action Plan for the Strengthening Plan 2023-2027 is put in place, in close link to the SPD implementation and monitoring. With the Agency's organisational culture change project 'Better together at ERA', the Agency will continue to invest resources and time to boost and refine the work environment and cooperation between staff members.

Through its communication activities, the Agency will design and implement actions to increase ERA awareness of the railway system and the dynamics of the railway industry. Moreover, the Agency will develop campaigns to provide EU citizens with relevant information and data demonstrating the added value brought by the Agency to society.

Clause 4 of the ERA Policy states that "People are our most valuable resource". Coherently, the Agency will implement the new HR strategy 2023-2027, offering clear and transparent career paths to staff members, allocate enough resources to make sure that good performance and success stories are adequately rewarded, and that skills and competencies are appropriate for the Agency mission and kept up to date. Internal roles are not only defined but also accompanied by a proper competency management system and communicated externally so that interfaces are clear to the stakeholders. The Agency also acknowledges the added value of diversity by implementing solutions to improve the gender balance in management and operational roles and to widen the number of nationalities employed.

The Agency will need to constantly monitor the budget allocation for 2024 in line with its ambition of deploying the envelope of 12 TAs envisaged in the SAP. The 2024 budget can be further impacted by the evolution of inflation and salary indexation. Several precautions have been taken into account, including some cross-cutting decrease in operational expenses for all activities, which generate a very high pressure on the budget planning. The Agency will continuously inform the EC and the MB on the budget implementation in 2024 and on any potential pressures arising during the year.

# Outlook for the years 2024 – 2026

# Growth of existing tasks:

In 2024, following the endorsement of the Strengthening Plan and the allocation of 12 additional Tas to the Agency to implement it, the Agency will dedicate these resources to the following priority domains, in line with the Strengthening Action Plan (SAP) 2023-2027:

a.) NSA monitoring  
b.) NoBo Monitoring  
c.) ERTMS and radio communication evolution  
d.) TSIs  
e.) The cleaning of national rules (technical, operational and safety rules)  
f.) CSM ASLP (13)  
g.) Digitalisation of the Agency's registers

# Strategy for achieving efficiency gains

The Agency is committed to continuously improving its functioning, streamlining its processes, optimising the engagement of its staff, and allowing for the reallocation of resources to the most important priorities. In the course of 2021, the Agency worked quite intensively on efficiency gains. This work progressed until the end of 2021 and led to the drafting of the Strengthening Plan, finalised, and endorsed by the Management Board at the beginning of 2022. The purpose of the Strengthening Plan is to make the strongest possible case in order to strengthen the Agency with resources matching the level of ambition necessary for achieving the important EC policy objectives for rail, in an effective and efficient manner, and benefit from high levels of ambition and efficiency within ERA's structure and methods.

With the document serving as a basis for the internal EC budget negotiations in 2022, the Agency received a proposed increase of 12 TAs in 2022. While the additional TA allocation is lower compared to the request from the Strengthening Plan (12 TAs proposed out of the 22 TAs requested), it can offer a good basis for the Agency to proceed with the implementation of the Strengthening Plan.

Following the adoption of the aforementioned plan, the Agency prepared the Strengthening Action Plan (SAP) 2023-2027, which details the actions that will be carried out within the next five years to strengthen the Agency's efficiency. The SAP 2023-2027 is organised along the following components/objectives:

a.) Drive an optimal resourcing of the following policy priority areas, matched by proportional outputs and outcomes, including efficiency gains:

NSA and Nobo monitoring  
ERTMS and radio communication evolution  
TSI related work  
Clean-up of national rules  
CSMASLP  
Digitalisation of the Agency's registers

b.) Maintain proper resourcing and further efficiency gains for the authority tasks,  
c.) Ensure a reduction in the Agency's administrative FTE allocation while maintaining regularity and legality. This will be possible thanks no but not limited to:

A workload analysis  
The Leaning of processes  
A training programme to facilitate the transition and provide the required technical skills to staff moving from administrative tasks to operational ones

d.) Ensure the overall projected FTE evolution by 2027  
e.) Ensure effective and efficient budget management (planning and execution), appropriate risk management

In order to ensure active involvement from all units across the agency and to monitor the implementation of the SAP, an internal task force has been set up in 2023. This task force ensures optimal communication across the Agency on the SAP and its milestones, as well as the implementation of key milestones. Finally, the Strengthening Action Plan has been added to the Strategic Calendar of the Executive Board of the Agency. A rapporteur has been appointed in 2023, who will support, guide, and monitor the implementation throughout 2024-2026.

# Negative priorities / decrease of existing tasks

# Paused activities for the year 2024

NSA Annual Performance review  
Review of NIB accident investigation reports

# Stretched and targeted outputs for the year 2024

The Agency has been working on the Common Safety Methods on the assessment of Safety Level and Safety Performance for several years, following its mandate. It also is one of the priorities of the Strengthening Action Plan. However, an information sharing system is needed to prevent future accidents and improve safety as a whole. The Agency does not have sufficient resources to create such tools. The Agency has therefore developed a paper with the resources required to develop and implement such tools, along with a timeline and the stages of implementation. The Information Sharing System (ISS) would require an estimated 2,375,000 EUR budget and a total of 8 FTEs. Based on substantial efforts, given the already very stretched budget envelope, the Agency allocated 185,000 EUR from its budget in 2024 to carry out the preliminary work for ISS-Stage 1. This investment needs to be complemented with the requested FTEs and budget (as per the dedicated SOS paper submitted to the MB), in order to ensure the project materialises its outputs and impacts.  
The Agency will continue to work intensely on its NSA monitoring activities, as it is one of the policy priorities highlighted in the Strengthening Action Plan. However, there is a need to develop together with Member States a new Priority Countries Programme (PCP) at EU level, with a broader approach including more railway stakeholders such as Member States, NSA/NIB, RUs, IMs, AsBo, NoBo, Notifying Authorities, National Accreditation Bodies and other checking bodies, and finally other operational stakeholders such as ECM, and wagon keepers. The PCP has the potential to provide a more holistic picture of railway safety and interoperability in the Member State, and to bring further changes to improve safety across the EU. In order to deliver this new initiative, the Agency would need an additional 50,000 EUR per year, along with 3 FTEs.

# Executive summary

The Annual Work Programme for 2024 details all the projects and services which will be carried out to contribute to the Agency's goals in the year. The structure of the Work Programme has been organised against desired long-term outcomes, implementing therefore an effective multi-annual work programme with developed objectives, as well as the intervention logic.

The annual work programme 2024 had been aligned to the priorities listed in the Agency's Strengthening Plan and the corresponding implementing document (SAP 2023-2027), which represents an anchor for the planning in SPD 2024 and the subsequent ones.

The Agency's efforts in 2024 are particularly focused on:

Technical and operational barriers: The Agency will work towards the reduction of technical and operations barriers within the rail market through, among others, the amendment of TSIs to be aligned with the technical innovations, harmonisation of national rules among MSs, continuous NoBo monitoring, the delivery of  $4^{\text{th}}$  Railway package activities (SSC, ERTMS TA, VA), and the deployment of ERTMS.  
Safety: The Agency will strengthen safety on rail through the development of a safety culture, the monitoring of National Safety Authority, the Common Safety Methods on Assessment of Safety Level and Safety Performance (within the boundaries linked to the resource constraints for the information sharing system), and other relevant projects.  
Data developments and ticketing: The Agency will continue to foster developments in the field of Linked data, as well as development under the TAP TSI. The Agency will continue its work on databases and registers optimisation.  
■ Communication and dissemination: The Agency will increase communicating and disseminating relevant information and knowledge to its stakeholders, as well as organising events and showcase the interesting projects and developments within the rail sector.  
Good governance: The Agency will strive for governance excellence and efficiency in all of its activities and will continue its efforts for improving budget execution rates and overall compliance and performance.

To best illustrate the alignment between SPD 2024 and SAP 2023-2027, the indicators and targets which contribute to the Strengthening Action Plan are indicated with a ticked box in the annual tables hereinbelow. Moreover, the number of FTEs linked to SAP 2023-2027 is also highlighted in a separate column.

# Strategic statement 8 - The Agency will ensure an effective and efficient governance of its portfolio of activities in order to offer the best value for money to citizens and business in the EU

<table><tr><td>Expected outcome</td><td>Effective and efficient governance of the Agency&#x27;s portfolioThe Agency&#x27;s activities provide value for money guaranteed to EU citizens and businesses across the EUThe expected outcomes have been further detailed in the following intermediate outcomes:1. Digitalisation of the Agency: Single source of data for internal access; Single source of data for external access; Data is only introduced once2. Staff understand the mission and vision of the Agency, internalise it and have the flexibility, the ownership/ autonomy with their activities, and a clear mutual understanding of their roles and responsibilities to actively contribute to the strategic direction of the Agency3. The Agency has a sound and agile governance framework, whose processes and administration favour clarity, efficiency and decision making at the right level.4. The SPD process steers the Agency&#x27;s strategy and multi-annual work programme development in an integrated, evidence-based, and coordinated manner as well as the monitoring of its effectiveness.

The following general principles guide the application of the legal framework concerning the Agency staff:

a.) The core of the Agency staff consists of Temporary Agents. All Temporary Agent positions have been identified as long-term positions. Due to the budgetary and establishment plan constraints the Agency is obliged to also engage Contract Agents in order to fulfil its mission;  
b) Temporary and Contract Agents are treated equivalently as far as possible.

In addition, it should be noted the Agency does not employ officials. However, there are cases where EU officials have been engaged following an external selection procedure and have therefore acquired the status of Temporary Agent in the Agency (whilst remaining an official on unpaid leave in their institution of origin).

# Selection and engagement procedures:

The procedure for selection and engagement of Temporary Agents and Contract Agents is based on Articles 27-34 of the Staff Regulations and Articles 12-15 and 82-84 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities (CEOS), the related Implementing Rules on the engagement and use of Temporary Agents and Contract Agents, the Financial Regulation (European Commission's Framework and that of the Agency), the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and the data protection rules.

The Agency also makes use of the EPSO CAST lists accessible to Agencies for the engagement of Contract Agents. Because of the Agreement on the European Economic Area nationals of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are eligible for working for the Agency.

The selection procedures for the engagement of Temporary Agents are carried out in accordance with Decision N° 121 of the Administrative Board of the European Railway Agency laying down the general implementing provisions on the procedure governing the engagement and use of temporary staff under Article 2(f) of the CEOS.

Depending on the function and the level of tasks and within the limits authorised by the establishment plan of the Agency, Temporary Agents are engaged at the following entry grades:

AST 1 to AST 4 for the function group AST  
AD 5 to AD8 for the function group AD

For managerial posts or highly specialised posts, the Agency can engage Temporary Agents at grades AD 9 and AD10 or at grade AD12 for Heads of Department.

The duration of contracts for Temporary Agents is governed by Decision N° ERA-ED-DEC-1109-2015. Staff holding a long-term post are normally offered an initial contract with a duration of four years with the possibility of renewal. The standard practice for a first renewal is normally for a two-year period and any further renewal is for an indefinite period.

For staff on short-term employment, the duration of the contract depends on the duration of the tasks to be carried out. At ERA, the duration of those contracts is predominantly related to the availability and duration of grants, or to a specific time determined project. In very rare cases it is to cover long-term absences.

The Agency is launching the following types of calls, published on ERA website's Recruitment portal:

Call for Interest (partial internal re-assignment): CFI/ERA/...  
Internal Mobility for Temporary Agents-Administrators: IM/ERA/AD/...  
Internal Mobility for Temporary Agents-Asists: IM/ERA/AST/...

External calls for Temporary Agents-Administrators: ERA/AD/2021/...

External calls for Contract Agents: ERA/CA/2021/...

# Temporary agents

The ERA Regulation 2016/796 which entered into force in 2016 makes no distinction between posts for long- term and short-term employment. Still a post can, in accordance with Article 16 of Decision N° 121, be defined to be for short-term employment when it involves tasks of a limited duration.

The decision to renew contracts of employment of Temporary Agents occupying a long-term post is taken by the Executive Director based on two considerations: the continuity of the post and the competences and performances of the jobholder, in accordance with Decision N° ERA-ED-DEC-678-2013 and the Procedure PRO_STA_01 on the "renewal and non-renewal of contracts of employment before the expiry date".

If a TA or former TA is awarded a second contract of employment in the same function group, this contract shall be considered as a renewal in the sense of Article 8 of the CEOS if the period between the end of the first contract and the starting date of the new contract is less than 6 months. If the period between the two contracts of employment is 6 months or more or if the new contract is in a different function group, the second contract of employment shall be considered a new contract of employment.

# Contract agents

The selection procedures for the engagement of Contract Agents are carried out in accordance with Decision n°210 of the Management Board of the European Union Agency on the general provisions for implementing Article 79(2) of the CEOS, governing the conditions of employment of contract staff employed under the terms of Article 3a thereof.

In accordance with Article 85 of the CEOs, contract staff can be engaged for a fixed period of at least three months and not more than five years. Contract Agents are engaged for their specific competence in different areas of administration (finance, HR, IT, logistics, legal, audit, quality management), in the railway domain or to perform manual or administrative tasks.

This type of contract is usually used to meet specific needs such as:

Administrative tasks;  
Coping with temporary peaks in workloads;  
- Launching projects or new activities for which long-term commitment in terms of staffing is unclear;  
- Replacing staff on long-term absences such as maternity leave, long-term sick leave or unpaid leave;

However, increasingly ERA has also engaged Contract Agents for other (long-term) tasks, such as:

Administrative and Logistician Support Agents  
■ Assistants  
Project Officers

# Seconded National Experts (56)

Seconded National Experts (SNEs) are staff employed by a national, regional or local public administration or a public intergovernmental organisation who are seconded to the Agency so that it can use their expertise in a particular field. SNEs are seconded from their national employer to the Agency's operational units on the basis of their specific competency and technical expertise in the railway domain, based on Decision n° 173 of the Management Board of the European Union Agency for Railways laying down rules on the secondment to the Agency of seconded national experts and national experts in professional training.

A possibility to mandate 'cost-free' SNEs also exists, where the Agency does not pay any allowances or cover any of the expenses related to the performance of their duties during their secondment, although the Agency does not deploy such SNEs at the moment.

SNEs assist the Agency staff and cannot perform (middle) management duties. The initial period of secondment may not be less than six months or more than two years. It may be renewed once or more up to a total period not exceeding four years. Exceptionally, the Agency's Executive Director may authorise one more extension of the secondment for the maximum duration of one year at the end of the four-year period. Each secondment and extension are subject to an exchange of letters. An SNE may be seconded once again provided that the conditions of secondment still exist and a period of at least six years has elapsed between the end of the previous secondment and the new secondment unless the previous secondments lasted for less than four years.

# Trainees

Professional traineeships last 10 months and are managed in accordance with Decision N° ERA-ED-DEC-1063-2015, depending on budget availability.

# Structural service providers (57)

At ERA, the majority of service providers are intra muros IT consultants.

# Mobility policy

# Mobility within the Agency

Decision  $N^{\circ}121$  of the Administrative Board of the European Railway Agency laying down the general implementing provisions on the procedure governing the engagement and use of temporary staff under Article 2(f) of the CEOS (adopted on 25.11.2016) and Decision  $n^{\circ}210$  of the Management Board of the European Union Agency on the general provisions for implementing Article 79(2) of the CEOS, governing the conditions of employment of contract staff employed under the terms of Article 3a thereof enshrine the scenarios for internal mobility for TA 2(f) and CA.

The Agency considers internal mobility when vacancies arise, but due to the very specific, technical competences of a big part of the staff, internal mobility remains limited.

Furthermore, members of the Agency staff can apply for vacant posts within the Agency advertised externally. A supplementary agreement in accordance with Article 10 of the CEOS will be concluded as required if existing staff get a new job.

# Mobility between Union Agencies

The implementing rules on the engagement and use of Temporary Agents 2(f) and Contract Agents define the scope of mobility between EU Agencies. A very limited number of the support staff who have left the Agency in previous years have accepted TA/CA positions in other Agencies.

Increasingly staff members who took up long-term Temporary Agent positions at the Agency come from other EU Agencies.

# Mobility between the agencies and the institutions

Some posts are filled following an external selection procedure by staff coming from other European institutions (in particular the Commission), although the number remains small.

# Annex VI. Environment management

# Executive summary

The revised SPD guidelines (63) require Agencies to compile and formalise their Environment management policy. To achieve this ambition, the first Environment management annex was drafted in which ERA summarised its commitment to higher policy goals, the measures already in place, as well as the potential future environment management initiatives and actions, taking in consideration the responsibilities of the Agency as a public administration body, while keeping in mind the impact of environmental initiatives on the Agency's limited human and financial resources. Despite these limitations, the Agency is a socially and environmentally responsible organisation which pursues, whenever possible, the adoption and related implementation of environmental measures and initiatives that can be achieved with the available means.

The Agency is committed to promote a culture of sustainability acting in a responsible and sustainable manner – see point 9 of the European Union Agency for Railways Policy (64). Concern for the environment and promoting a broader sustainability agenda are integral to ERA's professional activities and the management of the organisation. In addition, the Agency is committed to urgently respond, within the boundaries of its mandate and capacity, to the ongoing energy crisis.

The Agency's aim is to follow and to promote good sustainability practice, to reduce the environmental impacts of its activities and to help its stakeholders to do the same. The Agency's existing environment principles (65) are covered under the following broader topics:

<table><tr><td>Green building (66)</td><td>Climate protection</td><td>Environmental preferable purchasing</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation</td><td>Waste reduction and recycling</td><td>Sustainable resource management</td></tr></table>

ERA's wider work in the railway sector, including its authority and policy contribution to a fully-fledged functioning Single European Railway Area, is covered under the Annual Work Programme, in particular Strategic Statement 2 (67) and the specific project designated to "Green agenda" (ERA1234).

In addition to the broader policy context related to the Green Deal, the Agency pays attention to the environmental impact of its day-to-day operations (i.e. to its building, staff, management, administration, and functioning).

# ERA in the broader policy context related to environment

As an Agency of the European Union, ERA pledges to the Commission's European Green Deal (68) initiative. Consequently, ERA commits to deliver its part of the deal to make the EU's climate, energy, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net green-

house gas emissions by at least  $55\%$  by 2030, compared to 1990 levels – as defined in the EU Climate Target Plan 2030 (69).

Since the publication of the Communication from the Commission on the European Green Deal (70) in December 2019, ERA has strengthened its activities aiming at promoting the role of the railways in the decarbonation of the European transport sector. To make the European Union the first carbon neutral region in the world by 2050, lowering the transport emissions is crucial. Between 1990 and 2019, the transport emissions have gradually increased and reached  $25\%$  of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the EU. The transport sector is the second sector only to the energy sector in terms of emission.

However, looking at the same period, the emissions of the railway sector have gradually decreased and nowadays represent less than  $0.5\%$  of the transport-related emissions. In addition, railways are also the mode of transport with the lowest external costs (externalities).

ERA has a central role in fostering interoperability and safety of the rail transport which should eventually make it more attractive, more efficient and thereby increase the modal share of the railways, resulting the greenhouse gas emissions of Europe's transport sector, in line with the objectives of the EC Green Deal:

By 2050, the death toll for all modes of transport in the EU will be close to zero.

ERA's wider work in the railway sector, including its authority and policy contribution to a fully-fledged functioning Single European Railway Area, is reflected in all Agency's strategic statements which form part of the Single Programming Document (multi-annual and annual parts). The targeted conceptual work related to the Green agenda is captured in Strategic Statement 2 (71).

In 2021, ERA led by example by having been one of the main organisers of European Year of Rail 2021 (7), a flagship thematic initiative of the European Green Deal.

On the highest level, ERA also pledges to respect and act upon the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

# Environmental impacts of ERA activities

ERA's administrative operations related to its building(s) have direct and indirect impacts on the environment. ERA's impact on the environment falls under the following categories:

1. Use of electricity, including for heating and cooling, water, paper and stationery  
2. Generation of waste and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions (including by travelling / commuting)  
3. Land use with regards to biodiversity(73)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/bb2a3678-2269-46fc-8476-7b93d062ab0f/c2a9b9dac56f91cdfe5355a466e770b3f6f4388e3c92adc0db25265c02f9d2cf.jpg)

ERA pays attention to limiting the use of resources, taking the energy crisis into account, and minimising negative impacts on the environment.

The recent geopolitical developments make the environmental – and in particular energy-related issues – more visible than ever before.

# Accountability ceiling of ERA

ERA is committed to do the utmost to advance its environment management and neutralise its impact on the environment. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that due to outside factors ERA's leverage may be limited regarding some proposed environment actions.

Current ERA headquarters building was put at the disposal of ERA by Valenciennes Métropole through a rental contract. Other buildings (meeting rooms in Lille, parking) used by ERA are rented in office buildings and parking lots, where the environment management responsibilities and tasks lie with the property owner or manager. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Agency has re-assessed its approach to meetings with stakeholders and has limited the use of office spaces in Lille, as well as the missions of ERA staff and externals to Lille headquarters. A large number of the Agency's meetings have been held in remote mode, thus reducing the carbon footprint.

Moreover, ERA's new headquarters building project has a key focus on environmental considerations when setting up specifications and during negotiations. The new building project complies with the EMAS/HQE recommendations.

It has to be noted that the railway link with the adjacent Belgian city of Mons is missing for decades, with no rail service on the section between Valenciennes and the Franco-Belgian border. Despite recent plans brought back the hope for re-establishing the connection, as of today this condition leaves no feasible public transportation option for the significant proportion of ERA staff living in Belgium. ERA remains a vocal advocate of recommencing cross-border railway operations as defined in its Strategic Statement 1 (74), with a particular focus on this particular one. Nevertheless as of today, carbon footprint related to staff commuting from Belgium to France needs to be mitigated with less desirable alternative solutions, such as carpooling.

# Environment management initiatives and planned actions

2024 will be a transition year for ERA in the way initiatives linked to limit its environmental impact will be apprehended. Initiatives and actions will continue to be launched and implemented. In addition to that, indicators will be developed per main areas of actions (consumption of resources, mobility, public procurement, waste management and office space) which will then be used from 2025 onwards.

Methodological notes:

1. The actions listed in the sections below which require a budget envelope will start with a budget estimate as a pre-requisite. Budget availability will be assessed for those actions before proceeding with the implementation.  
2. Depending on the interest expressed for the volunteering group referred in part I, this group can assist with other actions listed in parts A-I.  
3. While some of the units/teams are referred in the column of responsibilities by the nature of their role in the organisation, the successful implementation of the strategy relies on the ownership and involvement of all staff members.

# Consumption of resources (energy & utilities)

# ERA to analyse the provision of local public transport passes to staff starting in 2023.

ERA will analyse analogous schemes at Commission and other Agencies and evaluate the feasibility of providing local public transport passes to staff (or retrospectively reimbursing staff for these passes) to further encourage staff to use public transport and thereby reduce their carbon footprint. The budget impact of such initiative should be properly factored.

# ERA to further improve its procurement by implementing green public procurement. ERA to advance green public procurement by promoting the use and order of "green office items" from the EC office supplies' catalogue.

Calls for procurement tenders of relevant goods and services include "Environmental and social contribution" among the technical evaluation criteria (e.g. decommissioned furniture disposal/re-use, recycling policy, donations) whenever it is relevant for the contract. Tenderers have to comply with these criteria and considerations to qualify for a contract. It is a standard ERA practice to build environmental considerations into procurement for relevant goods and services.

# Carbon footprint reduction and management of missions, meetings and events

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/bb2a3678-2269-46fc-8476-7b93d062ab0f/5ec7e353d1f741ae5b3477d57b26a4f0ee2a76aefea28f894eb60ef8b5a25bb6.jpg)

# ERA will promote and utilise the Commission's guidelines on organising sustainable meetings and events. It has implemented MIPS+ module of Sysper to replace MiMa and will compile regular reports on travel-related emissions. ERA encourages environmentally friendlier itineraries in its travel policy.

ERA adheres to Commission's guidelines on organising sustainable meetings and events (77), and commits to promote the guidelines and incentivise to its staff to apply the steps when organising meetings and events:

Step 0: Is a physical meeting/event necessary?  
Step 1: Is the venue sustainable enough?  
Step 2: Is the printed and promotional material sustainable?  
Step 3: Are the 3Rs applied? (Reduce, Recycle and Reuse)  
Step 4: Is the catering sustainable?  
Step 5: Are the accommodation and transport environmentally friendly?

Step 6: Have social aspects been considered?  
Step 7: Are you sharing environmental awareness? The Agency could strengthen the recommendation for internal and external attendees to select train transportation where convenient connections are available, or air travel options with smaller carbon footprint (e.g., more direct flight routes, less connections). In addition, travel policy and related internal communications will repeatedly emphasise to ERA staff that online meeting forms should be preferred and picked over travel intensive face-to-face meetings whenever feasible and expedient.

In 2024, incentives will be made for staff to travel to Innotrans in Berlin by train.

# Further reduction of paper and stationery consumption

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/bb2a3678-2269-46fc-8476-7b93d062ab0f/46dc8ec1b7f651ea839ad3d0422b31332ecf88efafadd8975727c7bded72af26.jpg)

ERA will continue to fully digitise workflows. It will further reduce the printouts of publications. In the limited cased of printers' use, ERA will maintain the use of eco-friendly / partially recycled A4 printing paper as a default printing medium.

ERA will advance further digitalisation of the Agency, including the replacement of paper-based processes with electronic workflows and other IT systems – in cooperation with the Commission's DG DIGIT – such as:

SYSPER (full rollout)  
Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365: office solutions for paperless document creation and storing (full rollout)  
Ares: document management and archiving system

ERA will continue to reduce the number of printed (paper-based) publications through close management of the communication & publication plan. ERA will increase the use of print on demand of its publications/materials and web publishing.

ERA will raise awareness among its staff to on further possibilities of moving towards paperless office. As part of it, instead of the usual stationery "welcome package", office supplies will continue to be stored in a designated office and colleagues will be invited to collect strictly what they need – on demand.

# Waste generation reduction, sorting and recycling

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/bb2a3678-2269-46fc-8476-7b93d062ab0f/19fc9c967515e9048352e3ffc2bed3eae8c90a9edede18cf8893f9eee2927962.jpg)

ERA will maintain – or if possible, improve – the selective recycling and waste collection arrangements in its current building, as well as in the new building. ERA will order office supplies and merchandise on an on-demand basis only, with preference to sustainable/recycled/eco-friendly distributable merchandise.

ERA will make sure that selective waste collection remains widely available in offices and common areas of the current building and undertakes to provide for the same in the new building. In the form of internal communication, ERA will raise awareness among its staff about these recycling arrangements.

Moreover, ERA has a partner to recycle decommissioned IT equipment.

# Current status and plan for certifications and standards

ERA does not hold a certification for any of the environment/energy management standards (e.g. EMAS, ISO 14001, HQE, ISO 50001). However, especially in the context of the new building project, ERA pays particular attention to the requirements listed in the respective standards. The new building is planned to be EMAS & HQE certified.

# Notes:

1. ERA HQ (Valenciennes): ERA is the only tenant in the ERA HQ building, the Agency exclusively occupies and uses all office and non-office spaces in the building. Therefore, all surface area is included under the  $5.250\mathrm{m}^2$  of office space (SHON, terraces are not considered).  
2. Lille Office - Espace International (Lille): ERA shares office spaces with the building landlord (CCI de Région) on the  $2^{\text{nd}}$  floor. Following the signature of the addendum n°4 to main Lease contract that will enter into force as of 01/01/2024, the leased total office space is reduced to  $68.50 \, \text{m}^2$  for a lease yearly fee of 13 865.00 €, where the "quote-part des parties communes" is  $2.04\%$ . ERA has an exclusive use of the "office space" (81) of the  $67.00 \, \text{m}^2$  considered in the rent, the remaining  $2.04\%$  included under "non-office" (82) are shared with the landlord and other tenants.

# Building project in the planning phase

Due to the growth of the Agency, the current building in Valenciennes does not offer any longer the required conditions to accommodate staff and activities related to the Agency's role as railways' Authority. Therefore, the Agency has re-allocated the majority of staff members in double office spaces as a short-term solution. Another short-medium term solution is the implementation of teleworking up to the limit set by the Management Board Decision on Teleworking.

In parallel, as part of a long-term solution, the Agency and Valenciennes Métropole have started defining the requirements for a new building to accommodate ERA activities after 2028 by means of a Study composed of different phases. In 2018, the Phase I of the Study confirmed that the current ERA HQ cannot accommodate all requirements related to the Agency activities and growth.

In 2019 and 2020, the Agency has managed to complete the Phases 2 and 4 of the technical and functional study resulting in the approval of the technical specifications that will be used as the base for the selection of architects in the Phase 3 of the Study.

Taking into account the experience gained during the pandemic with large-scale teleworking and new ways of working, the building capacity was revised, and the technical project adapted.

The main objective for the Agency during 2021 was to prepare the technical and financial dossier to be formally addressed to the EU Budgetary Authority for the approval of the New ERA building project.

In 2022, the Agency clarified with the DG MOVE, the EU Budgetary Authority, the steps related to the procedure to be followed to have the project formally approved. On the 31/10/2022, a letter was sent to the EU Budgetary Authority with the file as part of the Early information procedure under Article 266(2) of the Financial Regulation resulting in the presentation on the 17/11/2022 of the ERA project to the Committee on Budgets in Brussels, where it was noted that the file submitted by ERA was very comprehensive and clear. Following the exchange of views held in the meeting of the Committee on Budgets, some follow-up questions asked by Members during the discussion were sent to ERA. At this stage, the EU Parliament confirmed that the procedure "Information préalable" can be considered as closed.

In 2023, Valenciennes Métropole decided to transfer the building project to the "Banque des Territoires" that will launch the Call for Architects during Q4 2023 – Q1 2024 with the purpose to be able to draft a Rental Lease Agreement proposal. This draft Lease Agreement will contain all the financial conditions needed by ERA to launch the formal procedure (submission of the Final Technical and Financial Dossier) aiming at receiving the approval of the Budgetary Authority for the ERA Building Project.

ERA is in constant discussion with Valenciennes Métropole for the new building project. The technical file is ready (Tome fonctionnel, Tome technique, Programme Environnemental et « Dimensionnement Projekt ») and Valenciennes Métropole will launch a competition to select an architect. The plan is to launch the competition in Q1 2024 in order to select the architect in Q3 2024.

# Annex IX. Evaluations

The Agency has a system in place to monitor its performance and formalise an evaluation of the results achieved in the year into the SPD dashboard, as an ongoing tool, as well as through the Consolidated Annual Activity Report, which focuses on the achievements of indicators and targets set out in the SPD.

The following instruments are used for collecting the data and for triggering actions:

- Work progress reports, filled in by projects and service managers reporting the status of projects and services against the relevant plans, budget and human resources allocation, including SPD targets.  
Budget execution monitoring, a continuous activity based on a daily automated report fed with SUMMA data, displaying the level of appropriations, commitments and payments to date for each budget line and for each project/service  
Monthly management monitoring reports, analysing and reviewing project and staff allocation (actuals vs planned), budget execution and risks/ issues at project/service level  
Monthly budget review meetings with the Management Team to analyse the data from the budget execution monitoring and take timely decisions for deploying / redeploying the resources. The redeployment of resources is brought to the attention of the Management Board for information if the transfers are within one title or between titles but below the  $10\%$  threshold or for decision if the transfers are between titles and above the  $10\%$  threshold.  
■ IMCS, part of the internal monitoring programme aimed at verifying that processes, projects, services and products comply with internal and external requirements, including.  
IAS audits  
ECA audits  
Non-Conformity register, where deviations from the relevant rules and provisions are recorded

All the sources listed above allow the Agency governance bodies, namely the Management Team and the Management Board to monitor continuously the functioning of the Agency. In order to allow this, the Agency has developed a performance dashboard which is turning the data into meaningful information.

The dashboard provides figures, charts and visuals about:

Human resources (incl. information on statutory staff members, geographical and gender balance)  
Budget management (Revenues and Expenditure, with a breakdown to budget titles of budget envelope/appropriation and paid amounts to date)  
Authority tasks (incl. the number of SSC/VA/TA applications received, number authorisations/certifications issued to date, planned and actual hours per authorisation type)  
- Projects and services (incl. Budget and FTE planned vs. actual, status traffic lights with information on red status, overall cost analysis)  
Strengthening Action Plan (SAP) (recruitment status, SAP policy priorities, SAP milestones, budget execution)  
Audits (status on open recommendations)

# Terminology (87)

The following terms are used in the SPD - in accordance with the Commission guideline on evaluation:

Strategic Statement (88) is a coherent area of action with objectives and resources. It is the basic building block for the structure of the annual Work Programme, distinguishing between operational activities – directly related to the mission and core tasks of the agency, and horizontal/ cross-cutting activities – carried out to support operational activities and staff.

Objective describes what the agency wants to achieve either in the short or long term.

Indicator is a characteristic or attribute that is measured regularly in order to assess to what extent an objective has been met.

Baseline is the point of reference against which achievement or progress towards objectives is measured.

Milestone is an intermediate target set, expressed in quantitative or qualitative terms, measuring progress towards the achievement of long-term objectives.

Target is the ultimate desired situation, quantified and timed.

Inputs are the human and financial resources used and the time required to produce outputs.

Actions are the work carried out over a certain period of time, consuming resources and producing outputs in accordance with the objectives set.

Outputs are what is directly produced or supplied through the agency intervention. They often relate to the expected deliverables of the intervention and are identified based on its operational objectives.

Outcome is the envisaged medium to long term effects of a programme or policy output. While its results are not easily foreseeable and might not be entirely in the sphere of control of the Agency, the outcome represents an intermediate medium-term step between the agency' outputs and longer-term societal impacts. The Agency has structured its multiannual work programme according to desired outcomes to ensure all of its outputs will contribute positively to its vision & ambition.

Results are the direct effects of intervention(s) on the target groups.

Impacts are the indirect or long-term effects of an intervention on the EU or global society that are, at least partly, expected to be influenced by agency's interventions.

# Annex X. Strategy for the organisational management and internal control systems

The strategy gives an overview on how the internal control system is organised and is contributing to the mitigation of the risks to the achievement of Agency's objectives to acceptable levels.

The Agency is operating based on a management system designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the five internal control objectives derived from the Agency's Financial regulation as well as ensuring continuous improvement and the need to implement a flexible and effective governance. The management system is implemented through four high-level components (i) Strategic, (ii) Core, (iii) Support and (iv) Measurement and improvement. Each component is including all 17 principles of the Internal Control Framework (ICF). There is also a clear link with the internal components of the ICF (i.e. control environment, risk assessment, control activities and monitoring). This system is deployed further at the level of processes.

The roles and responsibilities for implementing the system are integrated as follows:

The Management Board represents the Member States, and the institutional stakeholders has a strategic role on budgetary and planning matters. It is overseeing the internal controls and risk management of the Agency. It ensures that the Agency fulfils its mission and performs the tasks assigned to it

The Executive Director (ED) in its capacity of Authorising Officer (AO) and under the supervision of the Management Board is ultimately responsible for the management of the internal control framework. The ED sets the tone at the tope and puts in place structures and processes to gain reasonable assurance that the system is operating effectively.

The heads of units/department in their capacity of/Authorising officer by delegation (AOD) must ensure that the internal controls are efficient and effective in their area of responsibility as per AO delegation of powers. Both AO and AOD in their capacity of process owners are responsible for continuous improvement of the processes.

The newly created function of manager in charge of Risk management and internal control is fulfilled by a middle manager. It oversees the monitoring the implementation of the internal control arrangements and for complete and accurate reporting on the operation and effectiveness of the internal control framework. This function is also in charge of facilitating the risk management process.

The accounting officer certifies the year-end accounts thus providing reasonable assurance that the accounts present a true and fair view of the financial situation of the Agency.

All staff should ensure at their own level of competency that their activities comply with rules and regulations and report any deficiency.

The delegations of powers for executing the budget are detailed in internal procedures. The implementation of the budget is done via projects and services which is reflected in

empowering project and service managers in managing the associated risks and resources without prejudice to the AO/AOD powers.

The IAS is the internal auditor of the Agency and performs independent assessment on the internal control systems based on a three-year plan. Complementary, internal audits are performed. The external audit is performed by the European Court of Auditors (for the legality and regularity of transactions) and an external company (for the accounts).

# Internal controls tools include:

Controls performed at all levels of the Agency  
■ Risk management, in particular at project/service level and Agency level where the most significant/relevant risks are captured including strategic risks (recorded in the agency/corporate risk register and reported in the CAAR). Risks are formally assessed at both inherent and residual level to make sure that the analysis of the effectiveness of the controls in place is ensured before additional mitigating measures are put in place (cost-effectiveness of controls).  
Corrective/preventive measures are established when recurrent and systemic errors are recorded. Ex-ante nonconformities involving significant amount of money ( $>15.000$  euros) are approved by the AO  
Internal control monitoring criteria for measuring the presence and the functioning of the principles are in process of being developed considering the risk environment and are focused more on effectiveness and efficiency.  
Follow-up of recommendations from ECA, IAS, Discharge authority as well as other sources (e.g. external evaluations) to ensure that the actions plans are effectively implemented within the agreed deadlines.  
An integrated reporting system to inform and alert management on the progress on the implementation of costs for each project/service as well as SPD outputs (monthly dashboard). The cost data is connected to the source (SUMMA). It includes several other parameters such as risks, issues, changes, corrective actions taken, quality, milestones etc.  
Budgetary status reports are produced on a daily basis including an overview per unit of the budget execution per budget line for all fund sources, financial information on commitments, payments and transfers, information on progress of planned procurement and contracts. The information helps achieving the performance targets in these particular areas.  
Ex-ante controls consisting in several checks of financial and operational aspects of transactions by the actors involved in the financial circuits. There is a very comprehensive checklist/templates as well as guidance which ensure an effective level of control. The specific controls are detailed in the manual of financial procedures which also included the steps to be taken for making a financial transaction, the various financial circuits by type of transaction and the different roles and responsibilities. The Agency is putting substantial efforts in updated these manuals/checklists.  
Sensitive function policy defines the management of functions involving a considerable amount of autonomy and executive powers with the aim of ensuring that actions are taken to mitigate the risk that the jobholders deliberately misuse their decision-making powers or influence with a view to gaining personal advantages  
Ad-hoc controls are additionally applied at the level of processes whenever the management assesses it is necessary to mitigate a specific risk (e.g. selection procedures, financial delegations).

The Agency's anti-fraud strategy has been developed in accordance with OLAF guidelines, it is setting clear objectives, actions and responsibilities and it is based on a standalone fraud risk assessment exercise adapted to the Agency's environment encompassing fraud

risks regardless of their criticality. The risk of fraud is duly considered when carry out the risk assessment exercise.

The strategy is focusing on three objectives:

■ Handle effectively actual or perceived conflict of interest,  
Enhance the promotion of high ethical values as well as increasing fraud awareness  
Enhance data and information security

The objectives are fully aligned with the fraud risks identified which include inherent significant risk of conflict of interest due to specific circumstances of the Agency's activities (i.e. regulatory powers with significant decision making powers and potential reputational, legal and financial consequences if conflict of interest not adequately managed; relatively limited 'market' for recruitment of staff as well as for entities which could provide services for the Agency), potential risk of cyber-attacks leading to operational damage, loss of data, unauthorised disclosure of information or breach of data; potential risk of outsourcing the data and information security without proper security risk assessment), risk of staff members not being fully aware of their ethics obligations as well as handling and reporting fraud. The Agency has put in place comprehensive control measures proportional to the level of risks and amount of risk identified which encompass (but not limited to) mandatory tailor-made trainings on ethics and separately on antifraud for all staff, mandatory submission of declaration of interests for all staff and members of the Management Board and of the Board of Appeal, ex-post/on the spot controls, review of internal procedures (including procedures for reporting and handling fraud). Control indicators enable assessment of effectiveness of the measures taken.

# Starting 2023, the Agency is implementing the following activities under a single service (Internal Management and Control System -ERA1158) to better support the assurance function:

1. The internal management system coordination – coordinating the proper implementation of the internal control framework,;  
2. The central financial verification;  
3. The contact point for IAS, ECA and EP discharge follow-up.

# Assessment of the effectiveness of the management system

The agency monitors continuously the efficiency and effectiveness of the Internal Control Framework. A yearly assessment report is produced where consideration is given to the results of controls mentioned above. All the internal control components and principles must be present and functioning well at all levels of the Agency to be considered effective. The results of the assessment are reported in the CAAR.

# Annex XII. Strategy for cooperation with third countries and/or international organisations

Since the adoption of the existing strategy for global cooperation (together with SPD 2018), the Agency is updating the scope of work in order to best address the priorities listed by the European Commission in this field, namely:

The EU transport policy aims at promoting greater development and stability in the neighbouring countries, enhancing connectivity with the neighbouring areas and towards Asia, and creating a level-playing field for international rail transport and the rail supply industry beyond EU borders. The Commission welcomes Agency's aspirations to provide technical support at Commission request. The Commission reminds that the main priorities as regards rail international cooperation fall into EU's neighbourhood, strategic partners and high growth economies beyond neighbourhood, and international organisations. Agency's international activities should not go beyond.

# Annex XIV. Strengthening Action Plan (SAP) 2023-2027

# 1. Context

In 2022, the Agency's Management Board adopted the Strengthening Plan prepared by the Agency in close cooperation with the European Commission. The purpose of the Strengthening Plan is to make the strongest possible case in order to strengthen the Agency with resources matching the level of ambition necessary for achieving the important EC policy objectives for rail, in an effective and efficient manner, and benefit from high levels of ambition and efficiency within ERA's structure and methods.

With the document serving as a basis for the internal EC budget negotiations in 2022, the Agency received a proposed increase of 12 TAs in 2022 (92). While the additional TA allocation is lower compared to the request from the Strengthening Plan (12 TAs proposed out of the 22 TAs requested), it can offer a good basis for the Agency to proceed with the implementation of the Strengthening Plan.

A very important challenge is represented by the fact that the additional TA allocation needs to be fully covered under the existing subsidy envelope. To make best use of this TA allocation and considering the external constraints related to the indexation of salaries and prices, the Agency is making a thorough assessment of its capacity to cover these costs in a sustainable manner until the end of MFF 2021-2027. Several measures are envisaged, such as the time-phased hiring of the TAs. The budget constraint on the subsidy side is therefore an element to be properly monitored and managed for the whole remaining period of the current MFF.

The current document describes the plan of actions which the Agency will put in place in the period 2023-2027 in order to implement the Strengthening Plan, taking into consideration the level of additional staff allocation proposed by the EC. It is hereinafter referred as SAP (Strengthening Action Plan) 2023-2027. This builds on actions already taken up to present to increase the efficiency of the support services and tools.

# 2. What we want to achieve

ERA has established an outcome-driven framework, placing strong emphasis on effectiveness (i.e. "doing the right things"), in line with the prioritisation of activities included in the Strengthening Plan. In parallel, a delivery structure based on Projects and Services has been established. Outputs of projects and services are followed up and measured using a dashboard approach.

With the Strengthening Plan, we will implement a series of improvement actions that should enable to achieve the most appropriate outcomes with the resources available. This is important not only to justify the additional resources requested by the Agency, but also in order to demonstrate that European taxpayer's money is used in the most effective way, so that the European railway system can develop towards attractiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.

Improvement actions will be assessed according to their impact as well as ease of implementation. Quantitative targets are defined (mainly related to the respective FTEs) and followed up/measured on a regular basis. The baseline is ERA SPD 2022 and the monitoring tools are ERA SPD Portfolio Management together with the SPD Dashboard developed already.

# 3. Objectives, actions, indicators, and targets

The SAP 2023-2027 mirrors the Strengthening Plan and translated it into concrete actions. It is based on the planning and monitoring framework and enablers already set up by the Agency, which includes:

the multi-annual planning in the SPD, with a clear focus on the intervention logic;  
the Agency's performance dashboard, including reporting to the EB and the MB  
the regular budget execution monitoring and reporting  
the Consolidated Annual Activity Report.

The annual work programmes will therefore be aligned to the priorities listed in the SAP, which represents an anchor for the multi-annual planning in what the priority policy areas are concerned. A direct tracking of SAP-related FTEs, outputs and targets will be includes in the SPDs.

The SAP 2023-2027 is organised along the following components/objectives:

a.) Drive an optimal resourcing of policy priority areas, matched by proportional outputs and outcomes, including efficiency gains  
b.) Maintain proper resourcing and further efficiency gains for the authority tasks  
c.) Ensure a reduction in the Agency's administrative FTE allocation while maintaining regularity and legality  
d.) Ensure the overall projected FTE evolution by 2027  
e.) Ensure effective and efficient budget management (planning and execution), appropriate risk management

# A. Ensure an optimal resourcing of policy priority areas, matched by proportional outputs and outcomes, including efficiency gains

Note: In addition to the balanced input/output ratio for the priority areas, efficiency gains are also embedded and measured with the same indicators. The latter represent the delivery of relatively more (ambitious) outputs for the same amount of effort compared to previous years.

# C. Ensure a reduction in the Agency's administrative FTE allocation

Note 1: This objective is referred to the administrative FTE allocation, but encompasses a wide scope (e.g. redepaying administrative posts to operational activities, redepaying technical staff who currently cover administrative tasks to operational tasks activities).

All references are to FTEs (not posts) to allow for counting savings and/or redeployments which account for partitions of one FTE.

Note 2: The sequencing is thought as follows:

i. Creating the capacity of potentially free FTEs through process leaning, including automation – as such, this does not account for a materialised saving, but is a pre-condition (step C2)  
ii. Identifying the opportunities to materialise that capacity – this can happen at contract end points (step C3)  
iii. Having the FTEs freed from administrative work needs to be followed up by their actual redeployment in operational areas (step C4)

# 4. Governance and monitoring arrangements

The SAP 2023-2027 is endorsed by the Management Board and steered by the HoU CAP under the coordination of the ED.

A dedicated Task Force is put in place for the period 2023-2027 to support the Action Plan implementation, composed of:

HoU CAP (Oana Gherghinescu)  
CAP team members (Thomas Willems, Koen Favyts, Marta Lenarcik, Andrei Lixandru)  
A representative by unit, selected and nominated by the corresponding HoU, following an internal call for expression of interest (organised in Sep 2022)

Heads of Units/Heads of Departments will be accountable for their respective contributions. The involvement of the individual members in the Task Force is envisaged on a part time basis, in addition to their daily tasks at the Agency.

Regular reporting is envisaged as follows:

Internal regular iterations with the Agency's Management Team  
A dedicated section will be set up as part of the SPD Dashboard to monitor the progress of the indicators listed in Chapter 2 of this document, by year of reference  
The SPD Dashboard is presented at every regular EB and MB meeting, which offers the possibility to MB members to regularly monitor the progress with the action plan implementation  
A gate review with the Management Board can be envisaged every two years to make the necessary updates to the Action Plan, depending on the evolution in the internal and external context of the Agency.  
Annual reporting as part of the CAAR

Synergies with the Better Together and the HR strategy work streams will be carefully ensured by the Task Force.

# 5. Risks

The following risks are identified and assessed according to the matrix below:

<table><tr><td rowspan="5">Likelihood of consequence</td><td>Very likely</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Likely</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Possible</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Unlikely</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Very unlikely</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Negligible</td><td>Minor</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Significant</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="5">Impact</td></tr></table>

They will be monitored and addressed as part of Agency's risk register.

Budget related  

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Risk assessment</td><td>Mitigating measures</td></tr><tr><td>1. The Agency might not be in the position to hire all 12 TAs in 2023 due to subsidy constraints. The inflation trend poses significant pressure on the Agency&#x27;s capacity to cover the salary costs in the absence of sufficient additional EU subsidy.</td><td>4</td><td>The Agency is carefully monitoring the budget execution to strike the optimal use of the existing resources in the spirit of sound financial management, while flagging early warning signals in case of subsidy gaps. We will react by an agile approach, having reserve lists in place but only conclude employment contracts when the budgetary means are available.</td></tr><tr><td>2. The revenues from Fees and Charges are not under the full control of the Agency. In particular, the volume of work can fluctuate due to seasonal trends during the year, but also more structurally, upwards (e.g. the need for re-certification following DAC deployment, go-everywhere trains etc.) or downwards (e.g. starting with the second round of safety certification for the same RU at ERA, the complexity of the issues and checks might drop compared to the first round).</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr></table>

Human resources and internal communication related  

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Risk assessment</td><td>Mitigating measures</td></tr><tr><td>3. The changes in the working patterns, together with the financial consideration for hiring at lower grades, might limit the attractiveness for the specialised technical jobs offered by the Agency in the future. This might hamper the business continuity, talent pool retention and by consequence, Agency&#x27;s capacity to deliver the technical outputs envisaged in this plan.</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4. Inherent internal communication sensitivity around the choices made as part of the action plan (non-replacement, redeployment etc.). In addition, given this internal redeployment, the pressure on legally binding administrative tasks will increase exponentially.</td><td>4</td><td>The Agency will indeed tackle this aspect with attention, by highlighting and supporting the opportunity of ensuring career paths from administrative tasks to operational tasks. Natural end-of-contract gate reviews will be used.</td></tr></table>

Output related  

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Risk assessment</td><td>Mitigating measures</td></tr><tr><td>5. With insufficient additional resources for the policy tasks, up to the full level of the need, the Agency might not be in the position to support the EC in responding to all standardisation areas linked to innovation over the next years. The allocation of additional resources might need to be reopened during the lifecycle of this Action Plan to identify priority areas for which the Agency&#x27;s involvement is further expected.</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6. Considering the complexity of the training program which could help redeploying administrative staff to operational tasks, it might have a limited buy in and/or efficiency and could require a period of time for completion which goes beyond the timeline of the Strengthening Plan.</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr></table>
