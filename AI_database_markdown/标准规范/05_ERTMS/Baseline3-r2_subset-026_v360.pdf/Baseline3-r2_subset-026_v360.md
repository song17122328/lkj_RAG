# 1.3 Introduction

1.3.1.1 Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.  
1.3.1.2 Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are rethinking their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which ATC systems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).

# 1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System

1.4.1.1 The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:

Cross border interoperability.  
- Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.  
- Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  
- Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling exploitation of maximum track capacity.  
- The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.  
- Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the world market.  
- Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic management.

# 1.5 About this Document

1.5.1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System (ETCS) from a technical point of view.  
1.5.1.2 Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM's) over a transition period. They might be removed in a future edition of the standard.  
1.5.1.3 To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

1.5.1.4 For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside the scope of the SRS.

# 1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS

1.6.1.1 The SRS covers 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this introduction.  
1.6.1.2 All readers may need to refer to the Glossary of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET-023).

# 1.7 Requirements

1.7.1.1 This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the technical interoperability. This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally identified as containing ERTMS/ETCS on-board and/or ERTMS/ETCS trackside requirements (see details in chapter 9).  
1.7.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated requirements, with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control-Command and Signalling TSI and in this SRS.  
1.7.1.3 For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs. In any case, the requirements of this SRS, which are allocated to the trackside and related to the implemented functions, shall be respected.  
1.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted.  
1.7.1.5 Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not generate any interoperability problems.

# 1.8 Contents of the SRS

1.8.1.1 The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System (ETCS) of ERTMS.  
1.8.1.2 This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find the relevant chapters.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 1.8.2 Chapter 1: Introduction

1.8.2.1 Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of the SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter.

# 1.8.3 Chapter 2: Basic System Description

1.8.3.1 Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure.

1.8.3.2 Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels.

1.8.3.3 Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements.

# 1.8.4 Chapter 3: Principles

1.8.4.1 Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to onboard and trackside subsystems.

1.8.4.2 The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.

# 1.8.5 Chapter 4: Modes and Transitions

1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all transitions between modes.

# 1.8.6 Chapter 5: Procedures

1.8.6.1 Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for interoperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to another.

# 1.8.7 Chapter 6: Management of older System Versions

1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and lists the exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used by the trackside subsystem.

# 1.8.8 Chapter 7: ERTMS/ETCS Language

1.8.8.1 Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 1.8.9 Chapter 8: Messages

1.8.9.1 Chapter 8 defines the application protocol (format and content of messages, logical sequence for radio) necessary to achieve technical interoperability.

1.8.9.2 The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protocol and the content of messages.

# 1.8.10 Chapter 9: Classification of the SRS clauses

1.8.10.1 Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of the SRS.  
1.8.10.2 In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment with the SRS, it identifies which clauses contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either because they contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or because they are of another type.

# 2.3 Introduction

# 2.3.1 Scope and purpose

2.3.1.1 The present chapter gives the basic description of the ERTMS/ETCS system proposed to achieve technical interoperability.

# 2.4 System structure

2.4.1.1 Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system will have to be partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.  
2.4.1.2 This defines two subsystems, the on-board subsystem and the trackside subsystem.  
2.4.1.3 The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of:

a) the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification;  
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;  
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3),  
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no interoperability requirement will be established.

# 2.5 Subsystems

# 2.5.1 Trackside subsystem

2.5.1.1 Depending of the application level (see further sections), the trackside subsystem can be composed of:

a) balise  
b) lineside electronic unit  
c) the radio communication network (GSM-R)  
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC)  
e) Euroloop  
f) Radio infill unit  
g) Key Management Centre (KMC)  
h) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

# 2.5.1.2 Balise

2.5.1.2.1 The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on-board subsystem.  
2.5.1.2.2 The balise is based on the existing Eurocalise specifications. These documents are included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.  
2.5.1.2.3 The balises provide the up-link, i.e. the possibility to send messages from trackside to the on-board subsystem.  
2.5.1.2.4 The balises can provide fixed messages or, when connected to a lineside electronic unit, messages that can be changed.  
2.5.1.2.5 The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group.

# 2.5.1.3 Lineside electronic unit

2.5.1.3.1 The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems.

# 2.5.1.4 Trackside radio communication network (GSM-R)

2.5.1.4.1 The GSM-R radio communication network is used for the bi-directional exchange of messages between on-board subsystems and RBC or radio infill units.  
2.5.1.4.2 Intentionally deleted

# 2.5.1.5 RBC

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

2.5.1.5.1 The RBC is a computer-based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train on basis of information received from external trackside systems and on basis of information exchanged with the on-board subsystems.  
2.5.1.5.2 The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the responsibility of the RBC.  
2.5.1.5.3 The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange between the RBC and the on-board subsystem.

# 2.5.1.6 Euroloop

2.5.1.6.1 The Euroloop subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction.  
2.5.1.6.2 The Euroloop subsystem is composed of an on-board functionality and by one or more trackside parts.

# 2.5.1.7 Radio infill Unit

2.5.1.7.1 The RADIO INFILL subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction.  
2.5.1.7.2 The RADIO INFILL subsystem is composed of an on-board functionality and by one or more trackside parts (named RADIO INFILL Unit).

# 2.5.1.8 KMC

2.5.1.8.1 The role of the KMC is to manage the cryptographic keys, which are used to secure the EURORADIO communications between the ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipments, RBCs and RIUs).

# 2.5.1.9 PKI

2.5.1.9.1 The role of the PKI is to manage and distribute digital certificates, so as to allow a secure on-line distribution of cryptographic keys between KMCs and from a KMC to the ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipments, RBCs and RIUs).

# 2.5.2 On-board subsystem

2.5.2.1 Depending of the application level (see further sections), the on-board subsystem can be composed of:

a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment;  
b) the on-board part of the GSM-R radio system;

# 2.5.2.2 ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

2.5.2.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is a computer-based system that supervises the movement of the train to which it belongs, on basis of information exchanged with the trackside subsystem.  
2.5.2.2.2 The interoperability requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment are related to the functionality and the data exchange between the trackside subsystems and the on-board subsystem and to the functional data exchange between the on-board subsystem and:

a) the driver;  
b) the train;  
c) the onboard part of the existing national train control system(s).

# 2.5.2.3 Onboard radio communication system (GSM-R)

2.5.2.3.1 The GSM-R on-board radio system is used for the bi-directional exchange of messages between on-board subsystem and RBC or radio infill unit.  
2.5.2.3.2 Intentionally deleted.

(*) Depending on its functionality and the desired configuration, the national system can be addressed either via an STM using the standard interface or via another national solution

2.5.3.1 Note: the entities inside the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment box are shown only to highlight the scope of the interfaces that are specified in the TSI CCS annex A.

# 2.6 Levels and transitions

# 2.6.1 Introduction

2.6.1.1 The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on-board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on-board equipment respectively.  
2.6.1.2 Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance. Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.1.3 For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines equipped with train control system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.

# 2.6.2 Definitions

2.6.2.1 A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment always co-operates with the ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.  
2.6.2.2 All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules.  
2.6.2.3 ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:

- ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not equipped with any train control system (ERTMS/ETCS or national system) or on a line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible)  
- ERTMS/ETCS Level NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with a national system)  
- ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally Euroloop or Radio infill)  
- ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside  
- ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train integrity supervision based on information received from the train)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

2.6.2.4 It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for example to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.  
2.6.2.5 Intentionally deleted.  
2.6.2.6 Intentionally deleted.  
2.6.2.7 It is possible to transmit information not intended for ERTMS/ETCS but for other systems over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels. This information is not used by ERTMS/ETCS.

# 2.6.3 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0

# 2.6.3.1 General description

2.6.3.1.1 Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not possible (e.g. commissioning or on-board/trackside failed components).  
2.6.3.1.2 In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give movement authorities to the driver.  
2.6.3.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.  
2.6.3.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.3.1.5 Level 0 uses no track-train transmission except Euroalises to announce/command level transitions. Euroalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except certain special commands are interpreted.  
2.6.3.1.6 No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to ERTMS/ETCS equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

# 2.6.4 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level NTC

# 2.6.4.1 General description

2.6.4.1.1 Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with national train control and speed supervision systems.  
2.6.4.1.2 Train control information generated trackside by the national train control system is transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national system.  
2.6.4.1.3 Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the performance and functionality of the underlying systems.  
2.6.4.1.4 Intentionally deleted.  
2.6.4.1.5 The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying national systems.  
2.6.4.1.6 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.4.1.7 Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track-train information except to announce/COMMAND level transitions and specific commands related to balise transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read.  
2.6.4.1.8 The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying national system. The active national system is indicated to the driver as part of that information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed.  
2.6.4.1.9 A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level.  
2.6.4.1.10 Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, in order to perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.  
2.6.4.1.11 Intentionally deleted.

# 2.6.5 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1

# 2.6.5.1 General description

2.6.5.1.1 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as an overlay on an underlying signalling system.  
2.6.5.1.2 Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via Eurobalises.  
2.6.5.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also protects against overrun of the authority.  
2.6.5.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
2.6.5.1.5 Level 1 is based on Euroalises as spot transmission devices.  
2.6.5.1.6 The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information.  
2.6.5.1.7 If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this information until it passes the Eurovalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has to observe the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release speed.  
2.6.5.1.8 Additional Euroalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.  
2.6.5.1.9 Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi-continuous infill is provided.  
2.6.5.1.10 Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is available and even at standstill.  
2.6.5.1.11 Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the operation without release speed.

# 3.3 Introduction

# 3.3.1 Scope and purpose

3.3.1.1 The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.  
3.3.1.2 The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.  
3.3.1.3 The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification number.  
3.3.1.4 Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as requirements.

# 3.4 Balise configuration and linking

# 3.4.1 Balise Configurations - Balise Group Definition

3.4.1.1 A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises.  
3.4.1.2 In every balise shall at least be stored:

a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise  
b) The number of balises inside the group  
c) The balise group identity.

3.4.1.3 The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the group.

# 3.4.2 Balise Co-ordinate System

# 3.4.2.2 Balise groups composed of two or more balises

3.4.2.1.1 Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system.  
3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse direction) is identified as balise group orientation.  
3.4.2.2.1 The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group.  
3.4.2.2.2 The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise numbers.

# 3.4.2.3 Balise groups composed of a single balise

3.4.2.3.1 Balise groups consisting of only one single balise are referred to as "single balise groups" in the following.

No inherent coordinate system

# 3.4.2.3.2 Level 1:

3.4.2.3.2.1 The assignment of the co-ordinate system shall be by means of linking data.  
3.4.2.3.2.2 For balise groups consisting of a single balise, the information "direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over" received from a previous balise group shall assign a co-ordinate system to the balise.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/0faaa886cb889c01939c985e57d7a936f951a7092496388e2c5c5a36046c8854.jpg)  
Figure 2: Assignment of a co-ordinate system to a single balise group by linking

# 3.4.2.3.3 Level 2/3:

3.4.2.3.2.3 The reference for the linking data shall be either a single balise group if a coordinate system has been assigned to it before, or a balise group consisting of two or more balises (with "inherent" co-ordinate system)  
3.4.2.3.3.1 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot evaluate the orientation of the last balise group detected, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is available to identify the orientation of the co-ordinate system of this single balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position by means of a position report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG and the "previous LRBG", if any.  
3.4.2.3.3.1.1 Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a co-ordinate system to this single balise group.  
3.4.2.3.3.2 When a single balise group is detected and the previous LRBG is known, the position report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move from the "previous LRBG" towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG): directional information in the position report pointing in the same direction as the direction reference shall be reported as "nominal", otherwise as "reverse".  
3.4.2.3.3.3 If the "previous LRBG" is not known, the "previous LRBG" and all directional information of the position report based on two balise groups shall be reported as "unknown".  
3.4.2.3.3.4 If a new single balise group (BG2), different from the current LRBG (BG1), becomes LRBG while the running direction of the train is opposite to the running direction when this current LRBG (BG1) was last passed, the "previous LRBG" and all

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

directional information of the position report based on two balise groups shall be reported as "unknown" (see Figure 2a).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/86d2e0316f0888f5e36a3eb340a8bd735ae1de2b17ac0016714e0b8565d8442e.jpg)  
Figure 2a: Position report based on two balise groups versus train running direction

3.4.2.3.3.5 If a single balise group, being the LRBG, is detected again, the LRBG and the "previous LRBG" of the position report based on two balise groups shall remain unchanged.  
3.4.2.3.3.6 The assignment of a co-ordinate system received from the RBC shall identify the balise group for which the assignment is given, and shall assign a balise group orientation "nominal" or "reverse" to this balise group relative to the on-board direction reference reported in the position report based on two balise groups (see 3.4.2.3.3.2).  
3.4.2.3.3.6.1 Note: From the sequence of reported balise groups, the RBC can derive the balise group orientation with which the balise group was passed.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/27ccfed6d186324588451a344f9c93f9ff6146ef875f3bc338371fa5d6e80092.jpg)  
Figure 2b: Example for assigning a co-ordinate system

3.4.2.3.3.7 For single balise groups reported as LRBG and stored according to 3.6.2.2.2c, awaiting an assignment of a co-ordinate system, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to discriminate if a single balise has been reported more than once and with different "previous LRBGs" to the RBC.  
3.4.2.3.3.7.1 Note: For a single balise group reported as LRBG awaiting the assignment of a coordinate system also the rules for LRBGs reported to the RBC (see 3.6.2.2.2) apply.  
3.4.2.3.3.8 A co-ordinate system assignment received from trackside shall be rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment if the referred LRBG is memorised (see 3.6.2.2.2c) to have been reported more than once and with different "previous LRBGs".  
3.4.2.3.3.8.1 Note: If a single balise group is memorised, according to 3.6.2.2.2c, more than once, and with different "previous LRBGs", the assignment of the co-ordinate system is ambiguous.  
3.4.2.4 Balise groups composed of one pair of duplicated balises  
3.4.2.4.1 A group of two balises duplicating each other shall be treated as a single balise group in case where only one balise is correctly read.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 3.4.3 Balise Information Types and Usage

3.4.3.1 In level 1, all information to the on-board system is given from balise groups or additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units (see section 3.9). In level 2/3, balise groups are mostly used for location information.  
3.4.3.2 A balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either for nominal or for reverse direction, or may contain information valid for both directions. In level 1, this information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5):

a) Non-infill  
b) Intentionally deleted  
c) Infill.

3.4.3.2.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.4.3.2.2 Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise group.  
3.4.3.3 Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of at least two balises shall be used.

# 3.4.4 Linking

# 3.4.4.1 Introduction

3.4.4.1.1 Aim of linking:

- To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action.  
- To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise.  
- To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4).

3.4.4.1.2 A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in advance.  
3.4.4.1.2.1 Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains repositioning information marked accordingly.

# 3.4.4.2 Content of linking information

3.4.4.2.1 Linking information shall be composed of:

a) The identity of the linked balise group.  
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

c) The accuracy of this location.

Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises.

d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or reverse).  
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the expected balise group.

3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation window of the furthest announced balise group.  
3.4.4.2.2 Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information  
3.4.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2.  
3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise group.  
3.4.4.2.3 For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to be used in case of data inconsistencies:

a) Train trip (Trip mode, see Chapter 4)  
b) Command service brake  
c) No reaction

For further details see section 3.16.2.

# 3.4.4.3 Unlinked Balise Groups

3.4.4.3.1 A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.  
3.4.4.3.2 Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.  
3.4.4.3.3 Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier.

# 3.4.4.4 Rules related to linking

3.4.4.4.1 When no linking information is used on-board, all balise groups shall be taken into account.  
3.4.4.4.2 When linking information is used on-board, only balise groups marked as linked and included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken into account.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.4.4.4.2.1 When linking information is used on-board and the expected balise group is referred in the linking information with a balise group with ID "unknown", a balise group marked as linked shall only be taken into account if:

a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single balise groups), AND  
b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, AND  
c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information.

3.4.4.4.3 The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from

- when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of the balise group  
until  
- the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the balise group  
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account.

3.4.4.4.3.1 Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group are defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy.  
3.4.4.4.3.2 Note: The interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the expectation window.  
3.4.4.4.4 In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location shall start from the previously linked balise group.  
3.4.4.4.5 The on-board equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking information.  
3.4.4.4.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall expect the next one announced in the linking information (if any) when:

a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window  
b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1

3.4.4.4.6.1 Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see 3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check its linking consistency and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the further next balise group announced in the linking information.

# 3.5 Management of Radio Communication

3.5.1.1 Note: the following section refers to the behaviour of the user application interacting with Euroradio protocols. How the messages are actually transported from the sender to the receiver user application is not relevant for this description.

# 3.5.2 General

3.5.2.1 Each communication session managed by an entity allows the exchange of data with only one other entity.  
3.5.2.2 Note: in the following sections reference is made to safe radio connections, whose definition and management is contained in Euroradio specification.  
3.5.2.3 Note: The information Initiation of a Communication Session and Version not Compatible (see sections 3.5.2.4 and 3.17) are the same in every system version.  
3.5.2.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to manage simultaneous communication sessions with at least two different entities.

# 3.5.3 Establishing a communication session

3.5.3.1 Only the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can initiate a communication session.  
3.5.3.2 Intentionally deleted.  
3.5.3.3 Note: Only communication sessions between an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and a trackside equipment (RBC or Radio Infill Unit) are considered here.

3.5.3.4 The on-board shall establish a communication session

a) At Start of Mission (only if level 2 or 3).  
b) If ordered from trackside.  
c) If a mode change, neither considered as an End of Mission nor triggered from condition g) below, has to be reported to the RBC (only if level 2 or 3)  
d) If the driver has manually changed the level to 2 or 3  
e) When the train front reaches the end of an announced radio hole  
f) When the previous communication session is considered as terminated due to loss of safe radio connection (refer to 3.5.4.2.1)  
g) When a Start of Mission procedure, during which no communication session could be established, is completed in level 2 or 3  
h) When outside the Start of Mission procedure, the driver has manually selected the RBC contact information (only if level 2 or 3)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.5.3.4.1 In respect of a), b), c), d), e) and h) of 3.5.3.4, the on-board shall not establish a new communication session with an RBC/RIU in case a communication session is currently being established or is already established with this RBC/RIU.  
3.5.3.5 The order to contact an RBC shall include

a) The identity of the RBC.  
b) The telephone number of the RBC.  
c) The action to be performed (establish/terminate the session).  
d) Whether this applies also to Sleeping units.

3.5.3.5.1 See table at the end of section 3.5.3.

3.5.3.5.2 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has to establish a communication session with an RBC whilst in session with another RBC, the existing communication session shall be terminated (see 3.5.5.2 for details) and the new one shall be established. Exception: the order to contact an Accepting RBC shall not terminate the communication session with the Handing Over RBC.  
3.5.3.5.3 The order to contact an Accepting RBC shall be part of the RBC transition order and shall include:

a) The identity of the Accepting RBC.  
b) The telephone number of the Accepting RBC.  
c) Whether this applies also to Sleeping unit.

3.5.3.6 The order to contact a Radio Infill Unit shall include

a) The identity of the Radio Infill Unit  
b) The telephone number of the Radio Infill Unit  
c) The action to be performed (establish/terminate the session).

3.5.3.7 The establishment of a communication session shall be performed according to the following steps:

a) The on-board shall request the set-up of a safe radio connection with the trackside. If this request is part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure or is related to the establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c), it shall be repeated until successful or a defined number of times (see Appendix A.3.1).

If this request is not part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure and is not related to the establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c), it shall be repeated until successful.

A request shall be repeated immediately after EURORADIO has indicated that setting up the safe radio connection has failed.

b) As soon as the safe radio connection is set-up, the on-board shall send the message Initiation of communication session to the trackside.  
c) As soon as the trackside receives the information, it shall send the system version.  
d) When the on-board receives the system version it shall consider the communication session established and:

- If one of its supported system versions is compatible with the one sent by trackside, it shall send a session established report, including its supported system versions, to the trackside.  
- If none of its supported system versions is compatible with the one sent by trackside, it shall send a version independent message indicating "No compatible version supported". It shall inform the driver and shall terminate the communication session.  
e) When the trackside receives the session established report or the information that no compatible system version is supported by the on-board, it shall consider the communication session established.

Figure 3: Establishment initiated by on-board

3.5.3.8 When a communication session is currently being established (i.e. at any time from the first request the set-up of a safe radio connection to the reception of the system version from trackside), the on-board shall no longer apply 3.5.3.7 a), 3.5.3.7 b) and 3.5.3.7 d) (i.e. it aborts the process of establishing it) and shall release the safe radio connection (if any) if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) The driver closes the desk during Start of Mission  
b) End of Mission is performed  
c) An order to terminate the communication session is received from trackside

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

d) The train passes with its front end a level transition border from a level 2/3 area to an area where level 2/3 operation is not supported  
e) An order to establish a communication session with a different RBC is received from trackside and the order does not request to contact an Accepting RBC

3.5.3.11 If the driver selects "Use of EIRENE short number" to contact the RBC, the on-board shall not use the stored RBC ID/phone number, if any.  
3.5.3.11.1 Note: The on-board stored short number for calling the "most appropriate RBC" is defined by EIRENE.  
3.5.3.11.2 Justification: In case of EIRENE short number selection by the driver, the termination of the connection if the "most appropriate RBC" does not match the one previously stored on-board (EURORADIO functionality) must not occur.  
3.5.3.12 Intentionally deleted.  
3.5.3.13 An order to contact the RBC may contain a special value for the RBC identity indicating that the on-board shall contact the last known RBC (i.e., using the stored RBC ID/phone number, if any); the phone number indicated in the order shall be ignored by the on-board equipment.  
3.5.3.13.1 If there is no RBC ID/ phone number stored on-board, the order to contact the RBC shall be ignored.  
3.5.3.14 Note: If a short number is used (considering trackside call routing), that number can be programmed into the balise instead of the normal phone number.  
3.5.3.15 An order to contact the RBC may contain a special value for the RBC phone number indicating that the on-board shall use the on-board short number.

# 3.5.4 Maintaining a communication session

3.5.4.1 When a communication session is established, in case of a loss of the safe radio connection, i.e., if the disconnection has not been ordered (see 3.5.5.1), the involved entities shall consider the communication session still established for a defined time. The defined time shall start as soon as EURORADIO has indicated the loss of the safe radio connection.  
3.5.4.2 When EURORADIO indicates the loss of the safe radio connection, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately try to set-up a new safe radio connection.  
3.5.4.2.1 If the safe radio connection is not re-established after the defined time (as defined in A.3.1), both, on-board equipment and trackside, shall consider the session as terminated.  
3.5.4.3 The attempts shall be repeated, until at least one of the following conditions is met:

- The safe radio connection is set-up.  
- The session is considered as terminated.  
- The train passes the location indicated in the RIU order "Terminate the communication session"

3.5.4.3.1 Note: if the session is considered as terminated due to 3.5.4.2.1, the attempts will be resumed immediately according to 3.5.3.4 f).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.5.4.4 Exception to 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.3: the on-board equipment shall not try to set up a new safe radio connection and shall stop any ongoing attempts if the train front is inside an announced radio hole (see 3.12.1.3). The on-board equipment shall try to set it up again when the train front reaches the end of the radio hole.  
3.5.4.5 In case a message has to be sent during the loss of the safe radio connection, this message shall be considered as sent.

# 3.5.5 Terminating a communication session

3.5.5.1 The termination of a communication session shall be initiated only by the on-board and in the following cases:

a) If an order is received from trackside (RBC, RIU or balise groups) (see sections 3.5.3.5 and 3.5.3.6 concerning the content of the order).  
b) If a condition requiring the termination of the communication session is fulfilled without any explicit trackside order. The situations in which such condition is met are detailed in other sections of this specification.  
c) Intentionally deleted.  
d) Intentionally deleted.  
e) Intentionally deleted.  
f) Intentionally deleted.

3.5.5.2 In case a session is established, the on-board equipment shall terminate the communication session according to the following steps:

a) The on-board equipment shall send a Termination of communication session message.  
b) As soon as this information is received, the trackside shall consider the communication session terminated and send an acknowledgement to the on-board.  
c) When the acknowledgement is received the on-board shall consider the communication session terminated and request the release of the safe radio connection with trackside.

Figure 5: Termination of a communication session

3.5.5.3 No further message shall be sent by the on-board after the message Termination of communication session.

3.5.5.3.1 Exception: In case a communication session is established and no acknowledgement is received within a fixed waiting time (see Appendix A.3.1) after sending the "Termination of communication session" message, the message shall be repeated with the fixed waiting time after each repetition.

3.5.5.3.2 After a defined number of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1), and if no acknowledgment is received within the fixed waiting time from the time of the last sending of "Termination of communication session", the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall consider the communication session terminated.

3.5.5.4 No further message shall be sent by the trackside after the message Acknowledgement of the termination of communication session.

3.5.5.5 Note: The information Termination of Communication Session and corresponding Acknowledgement are the same in every system version.

3.5.5.6 Messages from the RBC received onboard after the message "Termination of communication session" has been sent shall be ignored with the exception of the Acknowledgement of the termination of communication session.

3.5.5.7 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.5.6 Registering to the Radio Network

3.5.6.1 ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall order the registration of its connected Mobile Terminal(s) to a Radio Network:

a) At power-up

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) Following driver entry of a new Radio Network identity  
c) If ordered from the trackside

3.5.6.2 When powered-off, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall memorize the last received Radio Network identity (from trackside or from driver) and shall use it when powered-up again.  
3.5.6.3 If no Radio Network identity received from trackside or from driver could have been memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or at very first power-up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile Terminal(s) to a default Radio Network.  
3.5.6.3.1 Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default Radio Network identity (on-board equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is implementation dependent.  
3.5.6.3.2 Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is powered-up in an area not covered by the memorized or default Radio Network, attempts to register to this Radio Network will be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt is successful or a new Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from driver, preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from registering to any unwanted Radio Network.  
3.5.6.4 Intentionally deleted.  
3.5.6.5 On reception of the trackside order, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately order the Radio Network registration of each Mobile Terminal that fulfils the following conditions:

a) it is not yet registered to the ordered Radio Network, AND  
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND  
c) no safe radio connection is being set-up

3.5.6.6 If a Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the Radio Network ordered by trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall initiate the Radio Network registration once communication session is terminated and safe radio connection is released.  
3.5.6.7 If no Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a Radio Network, any order to contact an RBC or an RIU received from trackside shall be rejected by ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

# 3.5.7 Safe Radio Connection Indication

3.5.7.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the safe radio connection. To that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe radio connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set-Up failed”, “Connection Up”.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.5.7.2 In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use a "connection status" timer (see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication status "Connection Lost/Set-Up failed".  
3.5.7.2.1 Note: The purpose of the "connection status" timer is to avoid distracting the driver for any short disturbance of the safe radio connection.  
3.5.7.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the "connection status" timer as soon as the first request to set-up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is sent:

a) for what regards the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4.  
b) for what regards maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4

3.5.7.4 If the "connection status" timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the requests to set-up a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU.  
3.5.7.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as described in Table 1 according to the conditions in Table 2 (see section 4.6.1 for details about the symbols).

<table><tr><td>No Connection</td><td>&lt; 3 -p2-</td><td>&lt; 5, 6, 7 -p1-</td></tr><tr><td>1, 2 &gt; -p2-</td><td>Connection Lost / Set-Up failed</td><td>&lt;2 -p2-</td></tr><tr><td>4 &gt; -p1-</td><td>4 &gt; -p1-</td><td>Connection Up</td></tr></table>

Table 1: Transitions between the indication statuses of the safe radio connection

<table><tr><td>Condition Id</td><td>Content of the conditions</td></tr><tr><td>[1]</td><td>(a Start of mission procedure is ongoing) AND (the final attempt to set-up the safe radio connection failed)</td></tr><tr><td>[2]</td><td>(the “connection status” timer expires)</td></tr><tr><td>[3]</td><td>(no Start of mission procedure is ongoing) AND (the requests to set-up a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU for reason other than the successful set-up)</td></tr><tr><td>[4]</td><td>(the safe radio connection is set-up)</td></tr><tr><td>[5]</td><td>(the safe radio connection is released)</td></tr><tr><td>[6]</td><td>(the safe radio connection is lost) AND (the requests to set-up a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU for reason other than the successful set-up)</td></tr><tr><td>[7]</td><td>(the safe radio connection is lost) AND (the train front is inside an announced radio hole)</td></tr></table>

Table 2: Transition conditions for the indication statuses of the safe radio connection

3.5.7.6 For the case of an RBC/RBC transition, the safe radio connection indicated to the driver shall switch from the indication status of the safe radio connection with the Handing over RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following conditions is met:

a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report directly to the Accepting RBC with its maximum safe front end having passed the border, see 3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC),  
b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the minimum safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, see 3.15.1.2.7 and 3.15.1.3.9.

3.5.7.6.1 Note: During an RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table and a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each RBC.  
3.5.7.7 For the case of safe radio connection with RIU's, the safe radio connection indicated to the driver shall be the one related to the current infill area.

# 3.6 Location Principles, Train Position and Train Orientation

# 3.6.1 General

3.6.1.1 Two types of location based data are defined:

a) Data that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level transition orders, linking)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) Data that remains valid for a certain distance, referred to as Profile data (e.g. SSP, gradient).

3.6.1.2 Note: Determination of the Train Position is always longitudinal along the route, even though the route might be set through a complex track layout.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/717a14a3c59952bb5588950b5e80f9213d0029898ca1817b17a5cc7d88298a57.jpg)  
Figure 6: Actual route of the train

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/58fb0afef5d70540f41a47493b93a499c57481d1cdbaa089021471c896efaa93.jpg)  
Figure 7: Route known by the train

3.6.1.3 The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to a balise group, which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes:

- The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between the LRBG and the front end of the train  
The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4)  
- Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation (see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding:

- the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG)  
- the train orientation  
the train running direction

In case of an LRBG being a single balise group with no co-ordinate system assigned, directional information is defined in reference to the pair of LRBG and "previous LRBG", see 3.4.2.3.3

- A list of LRBGs, which may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing location dependent information (see 3.6.2.2.2 c)).

3.6.1.4 Balise groups, which are marked as unlinked, shall never be used as LRBG.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.6.1.4.1 Justification: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may not be known to the RBC.  
3.6.1.5 If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e. the side of the active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train orientation shall be as when a cab was last active.  
3.6.1.6 The "train orientation relative to LRBG" is defined as the train orientation related to the orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either "nominal" or "reverse".  
3.6.1.6.1 Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction controller position.

# 3.6.2 Location of Data Transmitted to the On-Board Equipment

# 3.6.2.1 Data Transmitted by Balises

3.6.2.1.1 All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer to the location reference and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs.  
3.6.2.1.2 Exception: Regarding infill information the section 3.6.2.3.1 shall apply.

# 3.6.2.2 Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC

3.6.2.2.1 All location and profile data transmitted from the RBC shall refer to the location reference and orientation of the LRBG given in the same message.  
3.6.2.2.2 For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met:

a) The on-board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference when reporting its position to the RBC (in the following termed as  $\mathrm{LRBG}_{\mathrm{ONB}}$ ). Only

- balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking information, if linking information is used on-board or  
- the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this balise group was passed  
 shall be regarded.  
b) The RBC shall use a balise group which was reported by the on-board equipment as a reference (in the following termed as  $\mathsf{LRBG}_{\mathsf{RBC}}$ ). At a certain moment  $\mathsf{LRBG}_{\mathsf{RBC}}$  and  $\mathsf{LRBG}_{\mathsf{ONB}}$  can be different.  
c) The on-board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at least eight  $\mathsf{LRBG}_{\mathsf{ONB}}$  last reported to the RBC.

3.6.2.2.2.1 Exception to a): When on-board position is unknown or when position data has been deleted during SoM procedure, the on-board equipment shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until the onboard has validated its position again by passing a balise group.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.6.2.2.2.2 Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position (as per 3.6.2.2.2.1) or during SoM procedure an invalid position which it is not able to confirm, the RBC shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a position report from the onboard having validated its position by passing a balise group.  
3.6.2.2.2.3 Regarding c): From the time it has reported an unknown position, or an invalid position during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message with an LRBG not set to "unknown", the on-board equipment shall also be able to accept messages from the RBC containing LRBG "unknown".  
3.6.2.2.3 Example: The following figure illustrates the on-board and RBC views of LRBGs:

Figure 8: On-board and RBC views of LRBG when train is reporting new  $\mathsf{LRBG}_{\mathsf{ONB}}$  "D"  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/09a6eb6d86597ea2598ca67f1140dc69deb2b9a05068dece427221ef7a4866a6.jpg)  
Balise groups A, C have been reported to the RBC and can be used by the RBC as LRBG  
Balise groups D - F: are known thanks to previously received linking information and can be used in the future as onboard reference

3.6.2.2.3.1 Note: Figure 8 illustrates the case where the RBC uses as reference the last received  $\mathsf{LRBG}_{\mathsf{ONB}}$ . The RBC could also use a previously received one (see 3.6.2.2.2 b)).

# 3.6.2.3 Data transmitted as Infill information

3.6.2.3.1 All location and profile data transmitted as infill information shall refer to the location reference of the balise group at the next main signal (identified by the infill information) and to the orientation given by the infill device. (See note after justification).

# 3.6.2.3.1.1 Justification:

- At locations where routes join: Infill information is the same for all routes, only linking information is different for different routes, see figure below (infill by means of balise group(s), loop or radio)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/7f47898edd63dd0f5fe19db7f201c377438f4716127673862d14a38c3bbb78cb.jpg)  
Figure 9: Routes Join in Rear of InFill Area

- In case of an infill area with multiple balise groups: all balise groups transmit identical information, as the information of all groups refers to the balise group at the main signal.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/99c719f89cabfa49ec0659e91fe095bfacfa042761333bb8a4dcc0ef901e953f.jpg)  
Figure 10: Location referencing of infill information transmitted by balise groups

3.6.2.3.1.2 Note: The orientation of infill information given by an infill device is defined in reference to (see also section 3.9):

- In case of a balise group, the orientation of the balise group sending the infill information  
In case of loop, the orientation indicated by the End Of Loop Marker  
In case of radio, the orientation of the LRBG indicated in the message

# 3.6.2.4 Data transmitted by Loop

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.6.2.4.1 It shall be possible to transmit non-infill location data by loop, which refers to a balise group as location reference.  
3.6.2.4.1.1 Note: Regarding infill information see section 3.6.2.3.  
3.6.2.4.2 The orientation of data transmitted by a loop is determined by the EOLM information which indicates how the directional information contained in loop messages is to be interpreted.

# 3.6.3 Validity direction of transmitted Information

# 3.6.3.1 General

3.6.3.1.1 The direction for which transmitted information is valid shall refer to:

a) the direction of the LRBG for information sent by radio  
b) the direction of the balise group sending the information.

3.6.3.1.2 Data transmitted to the on-board equipment (by balise or radio) shall be identified as being valid for

a) both directions  
b) the nominal direction  
c) the reverse direction

of the referenced balise group.

3.6.3.1.2.1 Deleted.  
3.6.3.1.3 When receiving information from any transmission medium, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall only take into account information valid for its orientation. Other information shall be ignored. Exception: for SL, PS and SH engines, balise group crossing direction shall be considered.  
3.6.3.1.3.1 If the train position is unknown, data received from any transmission medium valid for one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment. Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4 If no co-ordinate system has been assigned to a single balise group, data transmitted by trackside, which refers to that balise group requiring the co-ordinate system to be known (i.e. all data which are only valid for one direction (nominal or reverse)) shall be rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).  
3.6.3.1.4.1 Exception: if not rejected due to balise group message consistency check (see 3.16.2.4.4.1 and 3.16.2.5.1.1), data to be forwarded to a National System (see section 3.15.6) shall be accepted. Justification: the co-ordinate system of the balise group might be known to the National System by other means inherent to the National System itself.

# 3.6.3.2 Location, Continuous Profile Data and Non-continuous Profile Data

3.6.3.2.1 Location and profile data shall have the structure shown in Figure 12 below

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/2dccc0cc444f3a95ca5d7d96e391c33c5867dcb58f1a677f70be8b81df530fe7.jpg)

Figure 12: General Structure of location and profile data

3.6.3.2.2 With regard to Figure 12 the following applies to continuous profile data:

a) Value (n) shall be valid for distance  $(n + 1)$  
b) For distance (1) the previously received data shall be used (in case of an SSP this includes train length delay, refer to 3.11.3.1.3).  
c) Distances shall be given as unsigned incremental values representing the distance between value(n) and value(n-1).  
d) The last value (n) transmitted shall be valid for an unlimited distance unless value(n) represents a special "end of profile" value.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

e) If distance  $(n + 1) = 0$  then the corresponding profile value  $n$  shall still be taken into account.

3.6.3.2.3 With regard to Figure 12 the following shall apply to location data:

a) Distances shall be given as unsigned incremental values representing the distance between value(n) and value(n-1).  
b) For distance (1) the previously received data shall be used.  
c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.

3.6.3.2.4 According to Figure 12 the structure for non-continuous profile data shall allow to contain multiple elements (value(n) for length(n)) inside the profile.

a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as unsigned incremental values, each increment representing the distance between starts of element (n) and element (n-1).  
b) For distance (1) the previously received data (or initial data/default values, see section 3.7) shall be used.  
c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.  
d) Note: There is no relationship between length of element (n-1) and distance (n), i.e., elements may overlap.

3.6.3.2.5 It shall be possible for the RBC to shift the location reference, e.g., after a change of train orientation or running direction.  
3.6.3.2.5.1 Justification: Refer to Figure 13. To make it possible to shift the location reference if - due to the location of the LRBG and the start location - distance (1) would become a negative value.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/0a1bb338a50f30bc73dea7294786480d1ec85e0205ed04e785f51deaa49370ce.jpg)  
Figure 13: Shifted Location Reference (shown for continuous data /location profile, but also valid for non continuous data profile).

3.6.3.2.6 With regards to Figure 12 the following applies to linking information

a) The distance (1) shall be given to the first balise group included in the linking information  
b) The distance (n) shall be given as the distance between two consecutive balise groups  
c) Each value (n) shall represent the linking information related to that balise group.

# 3.6.4 Train Position Confidence Interval and Relocation

3.6.4.1 All location related information transmitted from trackside equipment shall be used by the on-board equipment taking into account the confidence interval to the train position, if required for safe operation.  
3.6.4.2 The confidence interval to the train position shall refer to the distance to the LRBG and shall take into account

a) On-board over-reading amount and under-reading amount (odometer accuracy plus the error in detection of the balise group location reference)  
b) The location accuracy of the LRBG.

3.6.4.2.1 Distance information received from trackside shall be evaluated on-board as nominal information (without taking into account any tolerances).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.6.4.2.2 Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the LRBG depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment until it is reset when another balise group becomes the LRBG.  
3.6.4.2.3 The value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information if available, if not, by the corresponding National Value, or the corresponding Default Value if the National Value is not applicable.  
3.6.4.3 When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8) location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received balise group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be relocated by subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the location related information:

a) the distance between the reference balise group of the location related information and the LRBG, retrieved from linking information if it is available and it includes both the reference balise group and the LRBG, OR  
b) in all other cases, the estimated travelled distance between the reference balise group of the location related information and the LRBG.

3.6.4.3.1 Justification: it is always the trackside responsibility to provide linking in due course, knowing this rule; if the location related information is to be used in situations where linking is not provided (e.g. TSR transmitted by balise group marked as unlinked), the trackside can include provisions, if deemed necessary, when engineering the distance information.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/d521c391349dd1fc29c4036dd6bc5d08874091be78f65e31799f8e91f6b095eb.jpg)  
Figure 13a: Reset of confidence interval and relocation, on change of LRBG

Confidence Interval = Function [Q_LOCACC; Odometer Error]

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board has read the balise group 1

- the Confidence Interval is reset taking into account the location accuracy of balise group 1, and on-board tolerances when determining the reference location of the balise group,  
- the nominal distance to EOA is relocated by subtracting D_LINK (1) from nominal distance (1), resulting in nominal distance (2). (Nominal distance (1) may be the distance to EOA received in the MA or the result of a previous relocation.)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/e03882c0a19bdef070467352a57bfaaa74c7e597f0cb79148a5e6b9bce55959a.jpg)  
Figure 13b: Relocation of trackside information referred to previously passed balise group, different from the current LRBG

When the on-board performs the transition to level 2, the MA stored on-board (referred to balise group 0) is relocated prior to its evaluation:

- If balise group 1 is still the LRBG, the first MA Section distance is relocated by subtracting D LINK (1) from MA Section (1), resulting in MA section (1')  
- If balise group 2 is already the LRBG, the first MA Section distance is relocated by subtracting  $(\mathsf{D\_LINK}(1) + \mathsf{D\_LINK}(2))$  from MA Section (1), resulting in MA section  $(1^{\prime \prime})$  
MA Section (2) distance remains unchanged

3.6.4.4 The train front end position shall be identified in the following way

a) The estimated front end position.  
b) The max(imum) safe front end position, differing from the estimated position by the under-reading amount in the distance measured from the LRBG plus the location accuracy of the LRBG.

I.e. in relation to the orientation of the train this position is in advance of the estimated position.

c) The min(imum) safe front end position, differing from the estimated position by the over-reading amount in the distance measured from the LRBG plus the location accuracy of the LRBG.  
I.e. in relation to the orientation of the train this position is in rear of the estimated position.

3.6.4.4.1 Note: The rear end position is referenced in the same way. However min safe rear end is only safe if sent together with train integrity information.

3.6.6.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display, only on driver request, the geographical position of the estimated front end of the train in relation to the track kilometre. The display of the geographical position shall also be stopped on driver request.  
3.6.6.2 The resolution of the position indication shall be 1 metre (sufficient to allow the driver to report the train position when communicating with the signalman).  
3.6.6.3 When receiving new geographical position information (from radio or from balise group), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall replace the currently stored

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

geographical position information (if any) by this new received one, continuing the ongoing geographical position calculation until at least one of the condition of 3.6.6.9 applies.

3.6.6.4 Geographical position information shall always use a balise group as geographical position reference balise group and if needed an offset from that balise group. A geographical position reference balise group shall be either:

a) part of the last reported balise groups memorised on-board, in case the information is transmitted by radio, OR  
b) the balise group transmitting the information, in case the information is transmitted by balise group, OR  
c) any balise group not yet passed at the time of reception of the information.

3.6.6.4.1 In case the information is received by radio and at least one of the announced geographical position reference balise group(s) is part of the last reported balise groups memorised on-board, the on-board equipment shall use the data related to the most recently reported balise group.  
3.6.6.4.2 From the currently stored geographical position information, the track kilometre reference given for a geographical reference location shall become applicable if the train has detected the related geographical reference balise group and has travelled the offset distance from this reference balise group.  
3.6.6.4.3 The announced and not applicable geographical references shall be deleted on-board if the train changes orientation.  
3.6.6.5 The distance travelled from the geographical reference location shall be taken into account when calculating the geographical position.  
3.6.6.6 In cases where the track kilometre is not incremental (jumps, changes in counting direction, scaling error) the reported position might be wrong between the point of irregularity and the next new reference.  
3.6.6.7 In cases where single balise groups are used as a reference for geographical position information and where no linking information is available (and therefore no orientation can be assigned to the balise group), the on-board equipment shall ignore the geographical position information related to these single balise groups.  
3.6.6.8 Intentionally deleted.  
3.6.6.9 The on-board equipment shall continue calculating the position from a track kilometre reference (i.e. this track kilometre reference shall remain applicable) until:

a) a new track kilometre reference becomes applicable, OR  
b) it is told not to do so, OR  
c) the calculated geographical position becomes negative, OR

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

d) no more geographical position information is available (e.g., deleted according to conditions in SRS chapter 4)

3.6.6.9.1 Once a track kilometre reference is no longer applicable, it shall be deleted.  
3.6.6.10 The following data shall be included in a message for geographical position (for every track kilometre reference):

- Identity of the geographical position reference balise group  
- Distance from geographical position reference balise group to the track kilometre reference (offset)  
- Value of the track kilometre reference  
- Counting direction of the track kilometre in relation to the geographical position reference balise group orientation.

# 3.8 Movement authority

# 3.8.1 Characteristics of a MA

3.8.1.1 The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: Structure of an MA):

a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to move.  
b) When the Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority is zero, the End of Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority); when the target speed is not zero, it is called the LOA (Limit of Authority). This non-zero target speed can be time limited.  
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement Authority that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.  
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined time.  
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity of the End of Movement Authority, when the target speed is zero. One release speed can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4).

f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.

- A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is called the Section time-out.  
- In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.

3.8.1.2 The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.  
3.8.1.3 Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):

- the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to fixed block principles)  
- the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to moving block principles)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

- the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of operation)

3.8.1.4 Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.  
3.8.1.5 Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:

a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.  
b) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.  
c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that the train has successfully stopped before its End of Movement Authority. If the overlap is still unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.

3.8.1.6 Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero, a target speed higher than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the train from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the responsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is received when the Limit of Authority is passed.

# 3.8.2 MA request to the RBC

3.8.2.1 It shall be possible for the on-board equipment to request a new Movement Authority from the RBC.  
3.8.2.2 The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.  
3.8.2.3 In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:

a) A defined time before the train reaches the perturbation location assuming it is running at the warning speed (see section 3.13.11 for details).  
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.8.2.3.1 Regulations to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggered when the train front has passed the resulting location (regards a)/time (regards b)  
3.8.2.4 The parameters given by the RBC also define whether the MA request shall be repeated until a new MA is received or not and if so, the time between each repetition.  
3.8.2.5 The given data shall be valid until new MA request parameters are given from the RBC.  
3.8.2.6 In case no MA request parameters are stored on-board and following an MA request no MA has been received, the request shall be repeated with a repetition cycle according to a fixed value (see appendix).  
3.8.2.7 In level 2/3: an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the driver selects start.  
3.8.2.7.1 In level 0, 1, NTC: if a level 2/3 transition is announced and a communication session is already established, an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the information "Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location" is received from balise group.  
3.8.2.7.2 In level 0, 1, NTC: the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also inform the RBC about the identity of the level 2/3 transition location balise group, as received through the information "Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location".  
3.8.2.7.3 In level 2/3: An MA request shall be sent to the RBC when any part of the track description is deleted according to A.3.4, except for situations a, b, f, k.  
3.8.2.8 Together with the MA request the on-board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s) why the MA request is sent:

a) Start selection by driver,  
b) Time before reaching perturbation location reached,  
c) Time before a section timer or the LOA speed timer expires reached,  
d) The track description has been deleted,  
e) Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location.

# 3.8.3 Structure of a Movement Authority (MA)

3.8.3.1 The distance to the End of Movement Authority can be composed of several sections.  
3.8.3.2 For each section composing the MA the following information shall be given;

a) Length of the section  
b) Optionally, Section time-out value and distance from beginning of section to Section timer stop location

3.8.3.3 In addition, it shall be possible to define for the End Section of the MA:

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

a) End Section time-out value and distance from the End Section timer start location to the end of the last section  
b) Danger point information (distance from end of section to danger point, release speed related to danger point)  
c) Overlap information (distance from end of section to end of overlap, time-out, distance from Overlap timer start location to end of section, release speed related to overlap)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/d98833e6ded8643bd6917d148385cdef029c99c526fb92ee582840d7c482185a.jpg)  
Figure 17: Structure of an MA

3.8.3.3.1 Note: If only one section is given in the MA it is regarded as the End Section.  
3.8.3.4 The Section timer stop location shall be inside of the corresponding section.  
3.8.3.4.1 Note: the End Section and Overlap timer start locations may be outside their corresponding section. One example can be seen referring to figure 22c: An infill MA towards a signal at stop will replace the previous End Section by a new short End Section starting at the infill location reference and ending at the next main signal, however the End Section and Overlap timer start locations still have to be consistent with the Interlocking timer start locations. Another example is when a timer start location is in rear of the LRBG.  
3.8.3.5 In level 3, no time-outs shall be used.  
3.8.3.5.1 Note: For level 3 functionality the split of responsibility between the RBC and the Interlocking has to be considered. Time-out of routes and related overlap can not be based on train position reports since the position report can be delayed compared to

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

the real position of the train. The route release and revocation of routes can not be carried out by the interlocking until permitted by the RBC.

3.8.3.6 When an MA is transmitted by a balise group, the length of the first section shall refer to the balise co-ordinate system of that balise group.  
3.8.3.7 In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance from the balise group at the main signal to the location of the main signal, i.e. the distance to EOA is given. Where available, information concerning danger point and overlap for this EOA may also be given.  
3.8.3.7.1 Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to the train.  
3.8.3.8 Note: In case the main signal is at danger in level 1, the on-board will supervise the given distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7) as the distance to EOA.  
3.8.3.9 When an MA is transmitted by radio from the RBC, the length of the first section shall refer to the balise co-ordinate system of the LRBG given in the same message.  
3.8.3.10 It shall be possible to give the length of a section to any location in the track.  
3.8.3.10.1 Note: A section can cover several blocks and is not restricted to block ends (see figures).

# 3.8.4 Use of the MA on board the train

# 3.8.4.1 End Section Time-Out

3.8.4.1.1 The End Section timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the End Section timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.  
3.8.4.1.2 When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside, the following shall apply:

a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly;  
b) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to the current position of the train).

3.8.4.1.3 In case no End Section timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater than its time-out value and apply 3.8.4.1.2.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.8.4.1.3.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section will soon be released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.1.4 In case an End Section timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time-out value with the value received with the new MA.  
3.8.4.1.4.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer.

# 3.8.4.2 Section Time-Outs

3.8.4.2.1 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section:

a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.  
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise group giving the MA.

3.8.4.2.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent of in which balise the variable information is given.  
3.8.4.2.2 When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside, the following shall apply:

a) the EOA/LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked section. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly;  
b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply;  
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked section).

3.8.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.8.4.2.3 The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed the associated Section timer stop location.  
3.8.4.3 Time-out of the speed associated with the End of Movement Authority (LOA speed time out)  
3.8.4.3.1 The on-board shall start a timer for the LOA speed:

a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise group giving the MA.

3.8.4.3.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent of in which balise the variable information is given.

3.8.4.3.2 When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside, the speed associated with the LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the SvL is defined on-board according to 3.8.4.5). Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

# 3.8.4.4 Time-out of Overlap

3.8.4.4.1 The Overlap timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the Overlap timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end. The timer shall be considered as started even if a time-out value "infinite" is given.  
3.8.4.4.2 When the Overlap timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside, the following shall apply:

a) the overlap information shall be deleted and the Supervised Location shall be determined in accordance with 3.8.4.5. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.  
b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted  
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA).

3.8.4.4.3 If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.  
3.8.4.4.4 In case no Overlap timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.  
3.8.4.4.4.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the Overlap will soon be released by the Interlocking.  
3.8.4.4.5 In case an Overlap timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA with an Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

board shall keep the Overlap timer running but replace the Overlap time-out value with the value received with the new MA.

3.8.4.4.5.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer.

# 3.8.4.5 Supervised Location

3.8.4.5.1 The Supervised Location (SvL) shall be defined on-board as:

a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out).  
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any).  
c) if not, the End Of Authority.

3.8.4.5.2 As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board.

# 3.8.4.6 Infill MA (level 1 only)

3.8.4.6.1 An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA.  
3.8.4.6.2 An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the on-board equipment is in FS or LS mode.  
3.8.4.6.3 The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in advance by the infill device.  
3.8.4.6.4 An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the linking information, regarding the main signal balise group to which it refers, is available.  
3.8.4.6.5 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:

a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the first encountered balise of the infill balise group.  
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop message.  
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.

# 3.8.5 MA Update

3.8.5.1 A new MA shall replace a previously received MA in the following ways:

a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced by the new data.  
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced balise group at the next main signal shall be replaced.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.8.5.1.1 Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1 and the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6).

3.8.5.1.2 When an infill MA is received, the on-board shall start a new MA section at the infill location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1).

3.8.5.1.3 If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.8.5.1.4 If a new MA defines an SvL while the on-board was supervising an LOA, this shall always be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.8.5.2 It shall be possible to update the length of an MA section by means of repositioning information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3).

3.8.5.2.1 Note: The concerned MA section need not be the end section.

3.8.5.2.2 Upon reception of repositioning information and only if linking information has announced a following balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information, the on-board shall update the length of the current MA section in which the train front end is.

3.8.5.2.3 A balise group message containing a movement authority shall not contain repositioning information for the same direction.

3.8.5.2.3.1 Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA.

3.8.5.2.4 The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be considered as an MA shortening by the on-board equipment.

# 3.8.5.3 Examples of MA update

3.8.5.3.5.1 Note: In some existing systems, information about the locked route is not complete.  
3.8.5.3.5.2 History of the situation (refer to the figure below):

a) Signal A gives an aspect to proceed up to signal Cx because it has received information about the locked route.  
b) Signal A can determine whether track 3 or track  $1 / 2$  is locked but is unable to distinguish between track 1 and 2.  
c) In the situation described the route is set to track 1 or 2.

# 3.8.5.3.5.3 In balise group A the following information is given:

a) The most restrictive track description from all routes (which could be a combination from the routes);  
b) The linking distance given to the farthest balise group containing repositioning information, the identification of the repositioning balise group is not known;  
c) For a given aspect of signal A, the most restrictive MA from all routes (the shortest sections from the routes and the lowest target speed at the End of Movement Authority);  
d) If some sections are time limited, the most restrictive timer.

# 3.8.5.3.5.4 Balise groups B (B1 or B2) give the following static information:

a) This is repositioning information  
b) Linking to the next balise group C  
c) The distance to the end of the current section (i.e. the distance to the end of section B1 - C1, or the distance to the end of section B2 - C2)

# 3.8.6 Co-operative shortening of MA (Level 2 and 3 only)

3.8.6.1 It shall be possible to shorten a given MA using a special procedure between on-board equipment and RBC. The procedure is as follows:

a) The RBC proposes a new MA with an EOA closer to the train than the current EOA/LOA, optionally with a mode profile.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check the train front end position versus the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA.

- If it is in rear, the on-board equipment shall accept the new MA.  
- If it is in advance, the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA remains valid  
c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision.

3.8.6.2 If the request from the RBC is granted by the on-board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.

# 3.9 Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only)

# 3.9.1 General

3.9.1.1 It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on-board equipment using

a) Balise groups  
b) Euroloops  
c) Radio infill units.

# 3.9.2 Infill by loop

3.9.1.1.1 If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes infill information, those devices are also identified as infill devices.  
3.9.1.2 The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of transmission media.  
3.9.1.3 If the on-board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested by the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by the on-board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously received information.  
3.9.1.4 Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already covered in previous chapters).  
3.9.2.1 An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the end of a loop. When receiving this information, the on-board equipment knows that it is entering/leaving a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it is possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop.  
3.9.2.2 Balise groups shall be used as EOLMs. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM information to the passing train.  
3.9.2.3 EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The general rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.9.2.4 EOLM information might be contained in a balise group that contains other information.  
3.9.2.5 The EOLM shall send the identity of the announced loop.  
3.9.2.6 The on-board shall only accept information coming from the loop with the announced identity.  
3.9.2.7 Deleted.  
3.9.2.8 Deleted.  
3.9.2.9 The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for reception of the loop information:

- Loop identity used to identify the loop.  
Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop telegrams.  
- Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where on loop messages can be received.  
- Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be received.  
- Indicator telling the on-board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or reverse to the orientation of the announcing EOLM.

3.9.2.10 The on-board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing the EOLM.  
3.9.2.11 When the on-board equipment reads the next main signal balise group or when it detects that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information possibly received from the loop shall be ignored.  
3.9.2.12 The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop telegrams to specific locations.

# 3.9.3 Infill by radio

3.9.3.1 In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on-board equipment orders to establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  
3.9.3.2 The orders shall be sent via balise groups or via Radio Infill units.  
3.9.3.3 The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored:

a) Intentionally deleted.  
b) If the on-board equipment does not include radio.

3.9.3.4 If the on-board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be established using the same protocols and interfaces as for Level 2/3 operations.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.9.3.5 If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via balise groups is received, the on-board equipment shall, once the location indicated in the order is reached:

a) terminate any existing communication session(s) with RIU(s) not indicated in the order  
b) as soon as a new communication session can be handled, establish a communication session with the RIU indicated in the order

3.9.3.5.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.9.3.5.1.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.9.3.5.2 Intentionally deleted.  
3.9.3.6 If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via Radio Infill unit is received, the on-board equipment shall:

a) If only one RIU communication session is ongoing, maintain the existing communication session and establish a new one with the RIU indicated in the order.  
b) If two RIU communication sessions are ongoing, maintain the communication session related to the current infill area, terminate the other one and establish a new one with the RIU indicated in the order.

3.9.3.6.1 Exception (degraded situation): if the on-board can handle only one communication session, the order shall be ignored.  
3.9.3.7 A Radio Infill Unit shall not initiate a communication session with an on-board equipment.  
3.9.3.8 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall be sent together with the following radio infill area information:

a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the order). Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location marks the beginning of the Radio Infill Area.  
b) Next main signal balise group identifier (ignored by the on-board if the action is Terminate communication session). Note: the reference location of this balise group marks the end of the Radio Infill Area.

3.9.3.8.1 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units (see 3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information.  
3.9.3.9 The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the operational level of the on-board i.e. the information in the balise group shall be taken into account as usual in level 1.  
3.9.3.10 The on-board equipment shall inform the radio infill unit

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

a) As soon as the location indicated in the order sent via balise groups is passed (i.e. entry of the train in the infill area)  
b) As soon as the next main signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise groups is read or the on-board equipment detects that it was missed.

3.9.3.11 The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on-board equipment shall include

a) Train identity (ETCS-ID of the on-board equipment)  
b) Position report  
c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group  
d) Time stamp

3.9.3.11.1 Justification:

a) The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages  
b) The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infill unit to identify safely where the train is going, even in the case of a points area

3.9.3.12 As soon as the radio infill unit is informed that a train has entered an infill area under its responsibility, it shall

a) Terminate a possible previous sending of infill information to the on-board equipment, AND  
b) Send cyclically the infill information corresponding to the message currently sent by the next main signal balise group indicated in the information from the on-board equipment.

3.9.3.12.1 Justification: case a) refers to the possibility that a report from the on-board equipment, after having passed the previous main signal, was lost.  
3.9.3.12.2 Note: A Radio infill unit may manage several signals, thus several Radio Infill Areas (see Figure 25a)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/72d2b446829bc50a5844850d6aa16f4c1a2061e15f2a477f3abeeb5a021d07ef.jpg)

RIU1 manages Radio Infill Area 1  
RIU2 manages Radio Infill Area 2 and 3  
RIU3 manages Radio Infill Area 4

3.9.3.13 The radio infill unit shall terminate the sending of infill information as soon as information is received, that the on-board equipment has read the next main signal balise group indicated in the order or that the on-board equipment has detected that it was missed.  
3.9.3.14 The radio infill unit shall evaluate the time stamp according to the principles of section 3.16.3.2.

The on-board equipment shall check the consistency of radio infill data, according to the principles of section 3.16.3.1 and 3.16.3.3.

3.9.3.15 When the on-board equipment reads the next main signal balise group or when it detects that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information related to this balise group possibly received shall be ignored.  
3.9.3.16 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication session according to the orders received from the trackside (balise group or Radio Infill units) or when the level 1 is left.  
3.9.3.17 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.10 Emergency Messages

# 3.10.1 General

3.10.1.1 Emergency messages shall be sent individually to each on-board equipment, either as high priority data or as normal priority data of the same radio connection, as described

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

in Euroradio specification. Only emergency messages can be sent as high priority data, not their acknowledgement or their revocation.

3.10.1.1.1 Justification: In case of hazardous events, it is possible to use high priority data in the radio connection between RBC and on-board equipment to get a quick reaction.  
3.10.1.2 An emergency message shall contain an identifier decided by the trackside.  
3.10.1.3 The same identifier shall be used in case the emergency message is repeated.  
3.10.1.3.1 If the on-board receives a new message with the same identifier it shall replace the previous one.  
3.10.1.4 Each emergency message to an on-board equipment shall be acknowledged, using the corresponding emergency message identification number.  
3.10.1.4.1 Note: This acknowledgement informs the RBC about the use of the emergency message by on-board equipment and is independent from the general acknowledgement for track-to-train messages, as specified in section 3.16.3.5.

# 3.10.2 Emergency Stop

3.10.2.1 It shall be possible to stop a train with a conditional or an unconditional emergency stop message.  
3.10.2.2 A conditional emergency stop message shall contain the information of a new stop location, referred to the LRBG. In case, when receiving this message

- the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the emergency stop message shall be rejected and the RBC shall be informed.  
- the train has not yet passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the emergency stop message shall be accepted, however this location shall be used by the onboard to define a new EOA/SvL only if not beyond the current EOA/LOA. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.10.2.3 When receiving an unconditional emergency stop message the train shall be tripped immediately.  
3.10.2.4 New movement authority received after any accepted emergency stop message and before the emergency message has been revoked, shall be rejected.  
3.10.2.5 Intentionally deleted.  
3.10.2.6 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.10.3 Revocation of an Emergency Message

3.10.3.1 The revocation message shall refer to the identity of the concerned emergency message.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.10.3.2 The revocation messages shall be acknowledged by the on-board equipment, according to the general acknowledgement procedure (see section 3.16.3.5)  
3.10.3.3 The revocation of an emergency message shall have no effect on the management of other emergency messages possibly received.  
3.10.3.4 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.11 Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients

# 3.11.1 Introduction

3.11.1.1 The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different kinds of Static Speed Restrictions.  
3.11.1.2 A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS level.

# 3.11.2 Definition of Static Speed Restriction

3.11.2.1 Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment.  
3.11.2.2 There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:

a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)  
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)  
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)  
d) Maximum Train Speed  
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)

f) Mode related Speed Restriction.  
g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Subset-035)  
h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset-035)  
i) Level Crossing speed restriction (LX SR)  
j) Override function related Speed Restriction  
k) Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted braking distance (PBD SR) (see 3.11.11)

3.11.2.3 The Static Speed Restriction categories are independent of each other. This means that one speed restriction category cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other category of Static Speed Restrictions.

Figure 26: Example of Static Speed Restriction categories on a piece of track.

3.11.2.4 Depending on the type of Static Speed Restriction train length may have to be used to ensure that the full length of the train has passed a Static Speed Restriction discontinuity before a speed increase shall be taken into account.  
3.11.2.5 Intentionally deleted.  
3.11.2.6 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.11.3 Static Speed Profile (SSP)

3.11.3.1.1 The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed, curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges.  
3.11.3.1.2 The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent. The relationship between track and train characteristics determines the individual Static Speed Profile for each train.  
3.11.3.1.3 It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit specified for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element.

# 3.11.3.2 Static Speed Profile Categories

3.11.3.2.1 It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories.  
3.11.3.2.1.1 The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

a) The "Cant Deficiency" SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific speed limit in a curve with regards to this category.  
b) The "other specific" SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories corresponding to the other international train categories

3.11.3.2.1.2 Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of specific SSP categories.  
3.11.3.2.2 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall:

a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default "Cant Deficiency" SSP  
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs  
c) specify, for each "other specific" SSP, whether it replaces or not the "Cant Deficiency" SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment according to 3.11.3.2.3

3.11.3.2.3 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall select the SSP best suited its "Cant Deficiency" train category, according to the following order of preference:

a) if available, the "Cant Deficiency" SSP matching its "Cant Deficiency" train category, OR  
b) if available, the "Cant Deficiency" SSP with the highest Cant Deficiency value below the value of its "Cant Deficiency" train category, OR  
c) the Basic SSP

3.11.3.2.3.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.11.3.2.4 Intentionally deleted.  
3.11.3.2.5 "Other Specific" SSP categories not relevant to the current train shall be ignored.  
3.11.3.2.6 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in a train belonging to at least one or more "other international" train categories shall use the most restrictive speed amongst:

a) the “Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other specific” SSP categories matching the train categories replaces the “Cant Deficiency” SSP, AND  
b) all the "other specific" SSP categories matching the "other international" train categories.

# 3.11.3.3 Train categories

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.11.3.3.1 A maximum of 31 train categories is defined to match the SSP categories. 16 "Cant Deficiency" train categories and 15 "other international" train categories.  
3.11.3.3.2 A train shall always belong to one and only one "Cant Deficiency" train category and may optionally belong to one or more "other international" train categories.  
3.11.3.3.3 The train category(ies) to which a train belongs is a part of its Train Data.

# 3.11.4 Axle load Speed Profile

3.11.4.1 It shall be possible to define an Axle load Speed Profile as a non-continuous profile.  
3.11.4.2 For each section with a speed restriction due to axle load, the different speed value(s) and for which minimum axle load category this speed value(s) applies shall be specified.  
3.11.4.2.1 Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category can be applicable to the same distance.  
3.11.4.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider the most restrictive speed restriction that is associated with any axle load category lower than, or equal to that of the train.  
3.11.4.4 For trains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given in the profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not consider any speed restriction due to axle load.  
3.11.4.5 The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be "no restriction due to axle load".  
3.11.4.6 Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with train length, shall be determined by the axle load speed profile information sent to the on-board equipment.

# 3.11.5 Temporary Speed Restrictions

3.11.5.1 The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of track infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc.  
3.11.5.2 All Temporary Speed Restrictions are independent of each other. This means that an individual Temporary Speed Restriction cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other individual Temporary Speed Restriction.  
3.11.5.3 Whether a speed increase after the temporary speed restriction shall be delayed with train length, shall be determined by the temporary speed restriction information sent to the on-board equipment.  
3.11.5.4 When two or more temporary speed restrictions overlap, the most restrictive speed of the overlapping temporary speed restrictions shall be used in the area of overlap.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.11.5.5 Each Temporary Speed Restriction shall have an identity to make it possible to revoke the Temporary Speed Restriction using its identity. The speed restriction shall be revoked immediately when revocation is received from trackside, without delay for the train length.  
3.11.5.6 It shall be possible to identify whether a Temporary Speed Restriction is possible to revoke or not.  
3.11.5.7 A new Temporary Speed Restriction shall not replace a previously received Temporary Speed Restriction with another identity.  
3.11.5.8 Temporary Speed Restrictions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.  
3.11.5.9 If the on-board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the same identity as an already received TSR, the new Temporary Speed Restriction shall replace the previous one, except when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified as non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR.  
3.11.5.10 In case the train has changed its orientation any Temporary Speed Restriction shall be deleted (operational requirement: will be executed due to the mode change).  
3.11.5.11 Intentionally deleted.  
3.11.5.12 It shall be possible for the RBC to order an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in Level 2 or 3 to reject revocable TSRs from balises.  
3.11.5.13 When ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has accepted an order to reject revocable TSRs from balises, this inhibition shall be stored and shall be effective immediately, but only for revocable TSRs received from balises thereafter.  
3.11.5.14 The inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises shall be deleted if any of the following occurs:

- the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is terminated, OR  
- in case of RBC/RBC handover, the train front end crosses the RBC/RBC border.

3.11.5.15 Note: this inhibition may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling applications when the RBC has more precise information about restrictions than can be given from balises. The RBC may then order inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises and instead send more precise TSRs to the train.

# 3.11.6 Signalling related speed restrictions

3.11.6.1 In level 1, it shall be possible to send to the on-board equipment a speed restriction with a value depending on the current state of signalling.  
3.11.6.2 This speed value shall be taken into account by the on-board equipment as soon as it is received on-board, with the exception of a signalling related speed restriction from

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

an infill device. In case of infill information the speed restriction shall be taken into account from the location reference of the balise group at the next main signal.

3.11.6.3 The speed restriction shall be valid until a new signalling related speed restriction is received.  
3.11.6.3.1 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches from level 1 to level 2/3, the signalling related speed restriction shall remain valid until a L2/3 MA is accepted by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  
3.11.6.4 In case of a signal at danger the signalling related speed restriction shall have value zero, which shall be evaluated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment not as a speed limit but as a train trip order.  
3.11.6.5 In case of infill information the signalling related speed restriction at zero shall be ignored.  
3.11.6.5.1 Note: The infill information will also include an EOA at the next main signal that will be supervised according to the normal rules.

# 3.11.7 Mode related speed restrictions

3.11.7.1 The value of the mode related speed restriction shall be determined by the corresponding national value or the corresponding default values if the national values are not applicable.  
3.11.7.1.1 Exception 1: For the modes On-sight, Limited Supervision and Shunting the speed limit can also be given from the trackside. The speed limit given from the trackside shall prevail over the National value and the default value.  
3.11.7.1.2 Exception 2: For the mode Reversing there is no National/Default value. The speed limit is always given from trackside.  
3.11.7.1.3 Exception 3: For the mode Staff Responsible the speed limit can also be entered by the driver. The speed limit given by the driver shall prevail over the National/Default value.

# 3.11.8 Train related speed restriction

# 3.11.9 LX speed restriction

3.11.8.1 It shall be possible to define the maximum train speed related to the actual performance and configuration of the train.  
3.11.9.1 It shall be possible to define a LX speed restriction when the train has to pass a non protected Level Crossing.

# 3.11.10 Override function related Speed Restriction

3.11.10.1 While the "override" function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value) shall be taken into account.

# 3.11.11 Speed restriction to ensure permitted braking distance

3.11.11.1 It shall be possible for trackside to request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance given by trackside.  
3.11.11.2 The order shall be given by means of a non-continuous profile defining:

- The start and end location for the speed restriction  
- The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculate the speed restriction value  
- Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or Emergency Brake  
A single gradient value applicable for the calculation

3.11.11.3 The speed restriction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be recalculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed restriction changes.  
3.11.11.4 The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall take into account that:

- The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3.  
- The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but without considering the adhesion profiles, the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions related to powerless section given by trackside.  
- The expected deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without considering the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions related to powerless section given by trackside.  
- The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.  
- If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also calculate a Service Brake Deceleration (SBD) curve based on the expected deceleration and that reaches zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.  
- The estimated acceleration shall be set to "zero".  
- If not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: Vdana0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_EBI(V_PBD)) if the

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake; V delta0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD)) if the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake.

- The train will travel a distance from the last encountered balise of a group that provides restrictive information until initiating the brake command. This travelled distance shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed considering a processing delay  $(T_{41})$  equal to SUBSET-041 § 5.2.1.1.  
- Regardless of how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see 3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the service brake feedback was not implemented.  
- Regardless of how the traction cut-off interface is actually configured (see 3.13.2.2.8), T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut-off was not implemented.

3.11.11.4.1 Note: Knowing how the PBD speed restriction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the appropriate permitted braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the brake command in due time when encountering a further balise group providing restrictive information. In other words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisions based on the characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information e.g. distances between balises in that group with regards to validity direction of transmitted information and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location.  
3.11.11.4.2 Note: If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, it is the responsibility of the trackside to also consider an estimation of the on-board over-reading and under-reading amounts at the time the brake command is initiated in order to lower the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI supervision limit.  
3.11.11.5 Note: Throughout the following formulas, all the distances marked with "d" (lower case) are counted from a single arbitrary reference location.  
3.11.11.6 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall seek the PBD speed restriction value (V_PBD) which satisfies the two following inequalities. The resulting value shall then be rounded down to the next lower multiple of  $5\mathrm{km/h}$ :

$$
A B S \left\{\left(V _ {P B D} + d V _ {e b i}\right) - \left(V _ {E B D} \left(d _ {o f f s e t} + D _ {b e c}\right) - V _ {d e l t a 0 P B D}\right) \right\} \leq 1 k m / h
$$

$$

$$

With  $dV_{ebi}$  as defined in 3.13.9.2.3 by substituting  $V_{MRSP}$  with  $V_{PBD}$

With  $V_{\text{delta0PBD}} = f_{41} \left( V_{\text{PBD}} + dV_{\text{ebi}} \right)$  or  $V_{\text{delta0PBD}} = 0$  (if compensation of speed inaccuracy is inhibited by National Value)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

With  $D_{bec} = \left(V_{PBD} + dV_{ebi} + V_{delta0PBD}\right)\cdot \left(T_{traction} + T_{berem}\right)$

With  $T_{\text{traction}}$  and  $T_{\text{berem}}$  as defined in 3.13.9.3.2

With  $d_{PBD}$  being the permitted braking distance given by trackside

With  $V_{EBD}(d)$  being the EBD curve that reaches zero speed at  $d_{PBD}$

With  $d_{offset} = L_{antenna-front} + T_{41} \cdot \left( V_{PBD} + dV_{ebi} + V_{delta0PBD} \right)$

If no speed value fulfils the above inequalities, then:

$$
V _ {P B D} = 0
$$

3.11.11.7 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the PBD speed restriction (V_PBD) shall be equal to the most restrictive value amongst the one computed from the EBD (see 3.11.11.8) and the one computed from the SBD (see 3.11.11.9). The resulting value shall then be rounded down to the next lower multiple of  $5\mathrm{km/h}$ .

3.11.11.8 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall seek the  $\mathsf{PBD}_{\mathsf{EBD}}$  speed restriction value which satisfies the two following inequalities:

$$
A B S \left\{\binom {V _ {P B D} + d V _ {s b i}} {-} \binom {V _ {E B D} \left(d _ {o f f s e t} + D _ {b e c} + \left(V _ {P B D} + d V _ {s b i}\right) \cdot T _ {b s 2}\right) - V _ {d e l t a 0 P B D}} \right\} \leq 1 k m / h
$$

$$
d _ {o f f s e t} + D _ {b e c} + \left(V _ {P B D} + d V _ {s b i}\right) \cdot T _ {b s 2} \leq d _ {P B D}
$$

With  $dV_{sbi}$  as defined in 3.13.9.2.5 by substituting  $V_{MRSP}$  with  $V_{PBD}$

With  $V_{\text{delta0PBD}} = f_{41} \left( V_{\text{PBD}} + dV_{\text{sbi}} \right)$  or  $V_{\text{delta0PBD}} = 0$  (if compensation of speed inaccuracy is inhibited by National Value)

With  $D_{bec} = \left(V_{PBD} + dV_{sbi} + V_{delta0PBD}\right)\cdot \left(T_{traction} + T_{berem}\right)$

With  $T_{\text{traction}}$  and  $T_{\text{berem}}$  as defined in 3.13.9.3.2

With  $T_{bs2}$  as defined in 3.13.9.3.3

With  $d_{PBD}$  being the permitted braking distance given by trackside

With  $V_{EBD}(d)$  being the EBD curve that reaches zero speed at  $d_{PBD}$

With  $d_{offset} = L_{antenna-front} + T_{41} \cdot \left( V_{PBD} + dV_{sbi} + V_{delta0PBD} \right)$

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

If no speed value fulfils the above inequalities, then:

$$
V _ {P B D} = 0
$$

3.11.11.9 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall seek the  $\mathrm{PBD}_{\mathrm{SBD}}$  speed restriction value which satisfies the two following inequalities:

$$

$$

$$
d _ {o f f s e t} + \left(V _ {P B D} + d V _ {s b i}\right) \cdot T _ {b s 1} \leq d _ {P B D}
$$

With  $dV_{sbi}$  as defined in 3.13.9.2.5 by substituting  $V_{MRSP}$  with  $V_{PBD}$

With  $T_{bs1}$  as defined in 3.13.9.3.3

With  $d_{PBD}$  being the permitted braking distance given by trackside

With  $d_{\text{offset}} = L_{\text{antenna-front}} + T_{41} \cdot \left( V_{PBD} + dV_{sbi} \right)$

If no speed value fulfils the above inequalities, then:

$$
V _ {P B D} = 0
$$

3.11.11.10 Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterative algorithm) to compute the PBD speed restriction(s) is an implementation issue.

3.11.11.11 The initial state for Speed Restrictions to Ensure Permitted Braking Distance shall be "no speed restriction".

# 3.11.12 Gradients

3.11.12.1 The gradient information for a given piece of track shall be transmitted to the on-board equipment in form of a gradient profile.  
3.11.12.2 The gradient profile shall be continuous, i.e., give a gradient value for each location within the piece of track covered by the profile.  
3.11.12.3 A gradient value shall be identified as a positive value for an uphill slope, and with a negative value for a downhill slope.  
3.11.12.4 The gradient profile shall contain the gradient information as a sequence of gradient values, constant between two defined locations each, see Figure 27.

3.11.12.4.1 Note: The figure above symbolises the engineering process to provide the values of gradients. Following the track height, the track must be split in segments giving for each segment a gradient value.  
3.11.12.5 It shall be possible via balise groups to send to the on-board equipment a default gradient for TSR, to be used for the parts of the track not covered by the gradient profile.  
3.11.12.6 The Default Gradient for TSR stored on-board shall be valid until a new Default Gradient for TSR is received.

# 3.12 Other Profiles

# 3.12.1 Track Conditions

3.12.1.1 The Track Condition function is used to inform the driver and/or the train of a condition in front of the train.  
3.12.1.2 A Track Condition shall be given as profile data (e.g. non-stopping area), i.e. start and end of the data is given, or location data (e.g. change of traction system) i.e. start location given, depending on the type of track condition.  
3.12.1.2.1 The starting point of a profile type track condition shall be evaluated taking into account the max safe front end of the train, the end of the profile taking into account the min safe rear end of the train. Location type data shall be evaluated taking into account the max safe front of the train.  
3.12.1.2.1.1 Note: The timing of output data to control train equipment (e.g. pantograph) is application specific.  
3.12.1.2.1.2 Exception 1: The starting point of a Big Metal Mass type track condition shall be evaluated taking into account the max safe antenna position, the end of the profile taking into account the min safe antenna position.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.12.1.2.1.3 Exception 2: The end of the Powerless section and the end of the Station Platform shall be evaluated taking into account the min safe front end of the train.  
3.12.1.2.1.4 Exception 3: The start and end of a tunnel stopping area and of a sound horn track condition shall be evaluated taking into account the estimated front end of the train.  
3.12.1.3 The types of track conditions to be covered by this function are:

- Powerless section, lower pantograph (initial state: no powerless section, i.e. pantograph not to be lowered)  
- Powerless section, switch off main power switch (initial state: no powerless section, i.e. main power switch not to be switched off)  
- Air tightness (initial state: no request for air tightness)  
Sound horn (initial state: no request for sound horn)  
- Non stopping area (initial state: stopping permitted)

3.12.1.3.1 Note: In case of regenerative brake switch off or magnetic shoe brake switch off, the deceleration of the emergency brake might be affected if the effect of these brakes was included in the calculation of the deceleration value.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.12.1.3.2 Note: In case of eddy current brake switch off the deceleration of the service brake or emergency brake might be affected if the effect of these brakes was included in the calculation of the deceleration value.  
3.12.1.3.3 Note: in case of powerless section the deceleration of the service brake or emergency brake might be affected if the effect of a regenerative brake not independent from the presence of voltage in the catenary was included in the calculation of the deceleration value.  
3.12.1.4 Intentionally deleted.  
3.12.1.5 The following actions shall be performed once a track condition has been received:

a) Indicate on DMI (see chapter 5, procedure "Indication of track conditions"), except "Station platform", "Change of allowed current consumption" and "Big metal masses".  
b) Send information with the remaining distance to an ERTMS/ETCS external function (see chapter 5, procedure "Generation of track conditions related information to an ERTMS/ETCS external function"), with the exception of big metal mass track condition, sound horn track condition, non stopping area, tunnel stopping area and supervision of radio transmission which are handled inside the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment.

3.12.1.5.1 Note: Whether some information shall be filtered (not shown to the driver or not sent to an ERTMS/ETCS external function) is outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
3.12.1.5.2 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS external function must be able to handle new track condition of the same type as previously received and covering the same distance.  
3.12.1.6 The train is permitted to run without any track condition information given from the trackside. The initial state shall then be used by the on-board equipment.

# 3.12.2 Route Suitability

3.12.2.1 Route suitability data defines which values concerning loading gauge, traction system and axle load category a train must meet to be allowed to enter the route.  
3.12.2.2 It shall be possible for trackside to send route suitability data as location data when needed.  
3.12.2.3 On reception of route suitability data, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall compare it with the corresponding Train Data stored on-board. Unsuitability exists if:

a) The loading gauge profile of the train is not included in the list of loading gauges accepted by trackside  
b) The list of traction systems accepted by the engine does not include the one received from trackside

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

c) The axle load category of the train is higher than the permitted one received from trackside

3.12.2.4 If at least one unsuitability exists, the closest location corresponding to the unsuitability(ies) shall be considered as both the EOA and SvL (instead of the EOA/LOA and the SvL (if any) derived from the MA), with no Release Speed. The driver shall be informed about all unsuitabilities.

3.12.2.9 The Train Data concerning route suitability is part of the Train Data sent to the RBC.  
3.12.2.9.1 Note: This allows for route suitability supervision to be used in systems external to the ERTMS/ETCS system.  
3.12.2.10 The train is permitted to run without any route suitability data given from the track. No default values shall be used or supervised by the on-board equipment, i.e. the initial state is that no restrictions related to route suitability exist.

# 3.12.3.4 Conditions for Start/End of Indication

3.12.3.4.1 It shall be possible to specify individual events for start/end condition of indication.  
3.12.3.4.2 The following events can be used to define the start condition:

- Location  
Mode (start display as soon as in mode)  
- Level (start display as soon as in level)

3.12.3.4.3 The following events can be used to define the end condition:

- Location  
Time  
Mode (stop display when leaving mode)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

- Level (stop display when leaving level)

3.12.3.4.3.1 It shall be possible to define whether one or all of the events used from the list in 3.12.3.4.2/3.12.3.4.3 have to be fulfilled to define the start/end condition. This definition shall apply to both start and end conditions checked by the on-board.  
3.12.3.4.3.2 In case a confirmation of the text message is requested, it shall be possible to define whether the driver acknowledgement is considered:

a) As always ending the text display, regardless of the end condition defined in 3.12.3.4.3.1  
b) As a necessary condition to end the text display, in addition to the end condition defined in 3.12.3.4.3.1.

3.12.3.4.4 The end condition shall be evaluated as soon as the start condition is fulfilled. No display shall take place if the end condition is immediately fulfilled.  
3.12.3.4.5 Once the text message is displayed and the end condition is fulfilled, the start condition shall not be re-evaluated.  
3.12.3.4.6 When the end event "location" is used, the length on which the text is displayed shall refer to the location used for the start condition, independently from other start events.  
3.12.3.4.7 In case a confirmation of the text message is requested, it shall be possible to define whether the service brake or emergency brake application shall be commanded if the driver does not acknowledge before the end condition is fulfilled.  
3.12.3.4.7.1 If the driver does not acknowledge before the end condition is fulfilled, the text message shall remain displayed until acknowledged by driver.  
3.12.3.4.7.2 If the driver acknowledges before the end condition is fulfilled, the on-board equipment shall consider the driver acknowledgement as requested by trackside (see 3.12.3.4.3.2).  
3.12.3.4.8 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.12.3.5 Report of driver acknowledgement to RBC

3.12.3.5.1 If trackside requests a report of driver acknowledgement, then it shall include:

- a text message identifier  
- the identity of the RBC to which the driver acknowledgement report is to be sent.

3.12.3.5.2 When the driver has acknowledged a text message with a request to report driver acknowledgement, the driver acknowledgement report, including the text message identifier, shall be sent to the RBC referenced in the request.  
3.12.3.5.3 A new text message with request for report of driver acknowledgement shall be rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment if it has the same text message

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

identifier as a previously received text message, which the driver has not yet acknowledged.

# 3.12.4 Mode profile

3.12.4.1 It shall be possible for trackside to send a Mode Profile. The Mode Profile can request On Sight mode, Limited Supervision mode and Shunting mode.  
3.12.4.2 For OS and LS mode the mode profile defines the entry and the length of the On Sight/Limited Supervision area. For SH mode the mode profile only defines the entry location to SH mode, any length given shall be ignored by the on-board.  
3.12.4.3 On reception of a new MA (with or without Mode Profile) the on-board equipment shall delete the currently supervised Mode Profile.  
3.12.4.3.1 Exception: When receiving a new MA by infill, any currently supervised Mode Profile shall be deleted only beyond the reference location of the infill information.  
3.12.4.4 In case the mode profile information for shunting is overwritten by a new shunting profile, before the on-board equipment switches to SH mode, a previous list of balise groups for SH area shall be deleted or replaced by a new list of balise groups for SH area.  
3.12.4.5 The beginning of the Mode Profile relates to the max safe front end of the train.  
3.12.4.6 The end of the mode profile relates to the min safe front end of the train.

# 3.12.5 Level Crossings

3.12.5.1 It shall be possible for trackside to inform the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment about the conditions under which a Level Crossing (LX) must be passed.  
3.12.5.2 Each Level Crossing shall have an identity, so that all LX information is independent of each other. This means that an individual LX information cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other individual LX information.  
3.12.5.3 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a new LX information with the same identity as an already received LX information, the new LX information shall replace the previous one.  
3.12.5.4 Level Crossing information shall be given as profile data, corresponding to the LX start location and the length of the LX area.  
3.12.5.5 Level Crossing information shall indicate whether the LX is protected or not.  
3.12.5.6 In case the LX is not protected, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be informed:

a) at which speed the LX is allowed to be passed  
b) whether the stopping of the train in rear of the LX start location is required or not

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.12.5.7 In case stopping in rear of the non protected LX is required, a stopping area in rear of the LX start location shall be defined.

# 3.13 Speed and distance monitoring

# 3.13.1 Introduction

3.13.1.1 The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus its position, in order to assure that the train remains within the given speed and distance limits.

3.13.1.1.1 Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on-board can only assure this when the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:

- Brake system of the train functions as specified  
- wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration  
- Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs) are correctly entered into the on-board

3.13.1.2 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released. However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake command is an implementation issue.  
3.13.1.3 Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements contributing to the speed and distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the following chapters.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/6f09325fc4dc4a939b26522fc5bb25a13583e4f28cae2d98ea1a4c9cc283d35d.jpg)  
Figure 28: Speed and distance monitoring overview

3.13.1.4 Throughout the following sections, all the distances marked with "d" (lower case), which are referred in parameters, formulas and figures, are counted from the current reference location of the on-board equipment (e.g. the LRBG).

# 3.13.2 Inputs for speed and distance monitoring

# 3.13.2.1 Introduction

3.13.2.1.1 The traction / braking models, the brake position / brake percentage are used for the definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a service brake command or an emergency brake command has been initiated.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.2.1.2 However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring.

3.13.2.1.3 The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are required for reference conditions set by trackside.

# 3.13.2.2 Train related inputs

# 3.13.2.2.1 Introduction

3.13.2.2.1.1 The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are:

a) Traction model  
b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake percentage  
c) Brake position  
d) Special brakes (interface configuration and status)  
e) Service brake (interface configuration and application)  
f) Traction cut-off interface  
g) On-board correction factors  
h) Nominal rotating mass  
i) Train length  
j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring  
k) Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed)

3.13.2.2.1.2 These train related inputs are acquired as Train Data (see 3.18.3.2 items b) c) and d)), except:

- the configuration of the special brakes, service brake and traction cut-off interfaces which are not affected by the Train Data acquisition,  
- the service brake application and the special brakes statuses which are continuously acquired on the Train Interface,  
the fixed values.

3.13.2.2.1.3 The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train Data, unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits).

# 3.13.2.2.2 Traction model

3.13.2.2.2.1 The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. It shall describe the time delay T_traction_cut_off from the traction cut-off command by

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

the on-board (t0) to the moment the acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is guaranteed to be zero (t1). The estimated acceleration value of the train shall be considered during this time delay.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/8bb303632ecf7c110b4d0e08633098ddcb5d1574cb7423bfa45cb3125d2e20ee.jpg)  
Figure 29: Traction Model

3.13.2.2.2.2 Note: The current value of A_traction is not known directly by the on-board. It is implicitly known as a contribution to the estimated acceleration, together with the acceleration due to gradient.

# 3.13.2.2.3 Braking Models

# 3.13.2.2.3.1 Speed Dependent Deceleration

3.13.2.2.3.1.1 The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.2 It shall be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent deceleration model.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.3 Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as follows:

- A_brake = AD_0 when 0 ≤ speed ≤ V1  
- A_brake = AD_1 when V1 < speed ≤ V2  
- A_brake = AD_2 when V2 < speed ≤ V3  
- A_brake = AD_3 when V3 < speed

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/1b5b3e9edfc2a377b022b7b9a3a8407544479af91e1f263739d0beef3b87db83.jpg)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# Figure 30: Speed Dependent Deceleration Model

3.13.2.2.3.1.4 The last step of A_brake(V) shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it has no upper speed limit.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.5 The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full in Figure 31)  
3.13.2.2.3.1.6 The model shall be used for the emergency brake nominal deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).  
3.13.2.2.3.1.7 It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of A_brake(emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V) for each combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.8 Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence of a specific brake on A_brake(emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V)). However, the choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for A_brake(emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.1.9 It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of A_brake_normal_service(V):

a) one set applicable when the brake position is in "Freight train in G"  
b) one set applicable when the brake position is in "Passenger train in P" or "Freight train in P"

3.13.2.2.3.1.10 A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0):

```python
If A_brake_service(V = 0) ≤ A_SB01
    A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)
if A_SB01 < A_brake_service(V = 0) ≤ A_SB12
    A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_1(V)
if A_SB12 < A_brake_service(V = 0)
    A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V)
```

3.13.2.2.3.1.11 Note: the two pivot values A_SB01 and A_SB12 are part of the A_brake_normal_Service model, i.e. they are train related input data for the speed and distance monitoring function.

# 3.13.2.2.3.2 Brake build up time

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.2.2.3.2.1 The deceleration A_brake is not available immediately after the on-board commands the brake. There is a time lag between brake command and the start of the brake force build-up. There is also time needed to build up the full brake force.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.2 The model for the brake build up time shall be given as a step function as explained in Figure 31.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/3f5d891f6ddf679202e00e87f0009111b143faa407f848d37ad4d94246531c61.jpg)  
Figure 31: Brake Build Up Time Model

3.13.2.2.3.2.3 In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined:

a) T_brakeReact (t0...t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on-board and the moment the brake force starts to build up.  
b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the zero to the moment when  $95\%$  of full brake power is reached.  
c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time.

3.13.2.2.3.2.4 The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.5 This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake (T_brake(emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake.service).  
3.13.2.2.3.2.6 Note: The equivalent brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning of the build-up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is compensated by a higher deceleration.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.7 Note: T_brakeReact and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the speed and distance monitoring function.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.8 It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake(emergency and T_brake.service for each combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current brake, magnetic shoe brake and Ep brake.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.2.2.3.2.9 Note: Individual values of T_brakeemergency and T_brake.service may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence of a specific brake. However, the choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for T_brakeemergency and T_brake.service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.  
3.13.2.2.3.2.10 Note: In general, T_brakeemergency and T_brake.service are determined by the pneumatic brake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the Electro-pneumatic brake system is used, it is possible that T_brakeemergency and T_brake.service are determined by another special brake.

# 3.13.2.2.4 Brake Position

3.13.2.2.4.1 The brake position shall be set to one of the following three values:

a) Passenger train in P  
b) Freight train in P  
c) Freight train in G

3.13.2.2.4.2 Note: The brake position defines the behaviour of the brake for specific train types.

# 3.13.2.2.5 Brake Percentage

3.13.2.2.5.1 If the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is applicable (see 3.13.3.2), they are used to derive A_brake(emergency(V), A_brake_service(V), T_brake(emergency and T_brake_service.  
3.13.2.2.5.2 Note: the conversion model has been designed assuming that all the provisions laid down in the UIC leaflet 544-1  $6^{\text{th}}$  edition, with the exception of sections 9.1.2, 9.2.2 and 9.3.3, apply for the acquired brake percentage.

# 3.13.2.2.6 Special Brakes

3.13.2.2.6.1 For each special brake (regenerative brake, eddy current brake, magnetic shoe brake and electro-pneumatic brake), the on-board shall be configured to define one of the following possibilities marked with an "X" in Table 3

<table><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2"></td><td colspan="4">configuration possibilities</td></tr><tr><td>No interface exists</td><td>Interface exists and status affects the emergency brake model only</td><td>Interface exists and status affects the service brake model only</td><td>Interface exists and status affects both emergency and service brake models</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Special brake</td><td>regenerative brake</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>eddy current brake</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>magnetic shoe brake</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ep brake</td><td>x</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr></table>

3.13.2.2.6.2 When an interface exists with the regenerative brake, eddy current brake, magnetic shoe brake system and/or the Ep brake on-board system and depending whether their status affects the concerned brake parameter(s), the speed and distance monitoring shall take into account their status "active" or "not active" to select the appropriate brake parameter(s) captured as Train Data, according to Table 4:

Table 3: On-board Configuration in relation to special brakes  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2"></td><td colspan="4">When interface exists and if status affects the brake parameter, selection of brake parameter according to status of:</td></tr><tr><td>regenerative brake</td><td>eddy current brake</td><td>magnetic shoe brake</td><td>Ep brake</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Brake parameter</td><td>A_brakeemergency(V)</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T_brakeemergency</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>A_brake.service(V)</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T_brake.service</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td></td><td>x</td></tr></table>

Table 4: Selection of brake parameters according to status of special brakes

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.2.2.6.3 When the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is applicable, A_brake(emergency(V), T_brake_emergency and A_brake_service(V) shall not be influenced by the status of a special brake. However, the conversion model offers the possibility that T_brake.service can be affected by the status of the regenerative brake, eddy current brake or Ep brake (see A.3.9).  
3.13.2.2.6.4 The on-board equipment shall be configured to define whether it is allowed to take into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, which is independent from wheel/rail adhesion, for the selection of the maximum emergency brake deceleration under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.6.2.1.6).  
3.13.2.2.6.5 Note: the choice to set to "allowed" the contribution of such special/additional brake in the selection of the maximum emergency braking effort, is rolling stock dependent.  
3.13.2.2.6.6 If it is allowed to take into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, which is independent from wheel/rail adhesion, the speed and distance monitoring function shall take into account the status "active" or "not active" of the special/additional brake to select the appropriate National Value under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.2.3.7.7).

# 3.13.2.2.7 Service brake

# 3.13.3 Conversion Models

# 3.13.3.1 Introduction

3.13.3.1.1 For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre-program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.

3.13.3.1.2 Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.

# 3.13.3.2 Applicability of the conversion models

3.13.3.2.1 The conversion models shall be used by the on-board equipment if the brake percentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the brake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the conversion models:

a)  $0 \leq V \leq 200$ , where  $V$  is the maximum train speed in km/h  
b)  $30 \leq \lambda \leq 250$ , where  $\lambda$  is the brake percentage in \%  
c)  $0 \leq L \leq L_{\max}$ , where  $L$  is the train length in  $m$  and where  $L_{\max} = 900m$  if the brake position is "Passenger train in  $P$ " or  $L_{\max} = 1500m$  if the brake position is "Freight train in  $P$ " or "Freight train in  $G$ "

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.3.2.1.1 Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model.

3.13.3.2.2 For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable, which means that braking models (i.e. pre-programmed deceleration profiles and brake build up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function.

3.13.3.3 Brake percentage conversion model

3.13.3.3.1 Input parameters

3.13.3.3.1.1 The input for the model shall be the brake percentage of the train as defined in 3.13.2.2.5.

3.13.3.3.2 Calculation of the basic deceleration

3.13.3.3.2.1 The basic deceleration A基礎(V) shall be given as a step function of the speed using the algorithm defined in Appendix A.3.7.

3.13.3.3.3 Output parameters

3.13.3.3.3.1 The output of the brake percentage conversion model shall consist of two speed dependent deceleration brake models, A_brake(emergency(V) for the emergency brake and A_brake_service(V) for the service brake.

3.13.3.4 Brake position conversion model

3.13.3.4.1 Input parameters

3.13.3.4.1.1 The input for the model shall consist of the brake position of the train as defined in 3.13.2.2.4, the train length and the target speed.

3.13.3.4.2 Calculation of the emergency brake equivalent time

3.13.3.4.2.1 The equivalent brake build up time for the emergency brake shall be determined as specified in Appendix A.3.8.

3.13.3.4.3 Calculation of the full service brake equivalent time

3.13.3.4.3.1 The equivalent brake build up time for the full service brake shall be determined as specified in Appendix A.3.9.

3.13.3.4.4 Output parameters

3.13.3.4.4.1 The outputs of the brake position conversion model shall consist of:

a) two values of the equivalent brake build up time to be used when the target speed (V_target) is equal to zero, one value for the emergency brake and one for the full service brake:

T_brakeemergency_cm0 as defined for emergency brake in A.3.8

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

T_brake_service_cm0 as defined for service brake in A.3.9

b) two values of the equivalent brake build up time to be used when the target speed (V_target) is different from zero, one value for the emergency brake and one for the full service brake:

T_brake(emergency_cmt as defined for emergency brake in A.3.8

T_brake_service_cmt as defined for service brake in A.3.9

# 3.13.4 Acceleration / Deceleration due to gradient

# 3.13.4.1 Introduction

3.13.4.1.1 The elements of the gradient profile given from trackside shall be compensated:

a) in location according to the train length as defined in 3.13.4.2  
b) in value according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3 in order to derive the corresponding acceleration/deceleration.

Figure 35: Compensation on the gradient profile

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.4.1.2 The default gradient for TSR shall be compensated in value according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3.  
3.13.4.1.3 For all locations not covered by the gradient profile, the on-board shall consider the gradient value as:

a) the default gradient for TSR, if available and if the concerned target is due to a TSR  
b) zero, for other cases.

# 3.13.4.2 Train length compensation

3.13.4.2.1 Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any location between the current (actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35).

# 3.13.4.3 Rotating mass

3.13.4.3.1 The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see Figure 35).  
3.13.4.3.1.1 Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for the train without rotating mass.  
3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.  
3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used:

a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:

- Uphill: A-gradient = g * grad / (1000 + 10*M_rotating_max)  
- Downhill: A-gradient = g * grad / (1000 + 10*M_rotating_min)

b) If M_rotating_nom is known:

Uphill: A-gradient = g * grad / (1000 + 10*M_rotating_nom)  
- Downhill: A-gradient = g * grad / (1000 + 10*M_rotating_nom)

Legend:

A-gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

$g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$  - acceleration of gravity in  $\text{m/s}^2$

grad = gradient values in % (positive = uphill)

M_rotating_nom = nominal rotating mass (part of train data) as a percentage of the total train weight

M_rotating_max = maximum possible rotating mass (see A.3.1) as a percentage of the total train weight

M_rotating_min = minimum possible rotating mass (see A.3.1) as a percentage of the total train weight

# 3.13.5 Determination of locations without special brake contribution and with reduced adhesion conditions

3.13.5.1 As long as it uses a track condition profile given by trackside, the on-board shall consider locations without special brake contribution over a distance going from the start location of the profile to the foot of the deceleration curve (EBD, SBD or GUI, see sections 3.13.8.3, 3.13.8.4 and 3.13.8.5).

3.13.5.2 If the status of a special brake is "not active", all locations shall be considered without the contribution of this special brake.

3.13.5.2.1 Note: in such case, a track condition profile implying the inhibition of this special brake will have no effect.

3.13.5.3 From the adhesion profile given by trackside, the on-board shall consider locations with reduced adhesion conditions over a distance going from the start location of the profile to the location derived by adding the train length to the end location of the profile.

3.13.5.4 When slippery rail is selected by the driver, all locations shall be considered with reduced adhesion conditions.

3.13.5.5 The speed and distance monitoring shall use, as resulting reduced adhesion conditions, the most restrictive value of the adhesion conditions selected by the driver and the adhesion conditions calculated from the trackside profile.

# 3.13.8 Determination of targets and brake deceleration curves

# 3.13.8.1 Introduction

3.13.8.1.1 A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train must decelerate before reaching the target location.  
3.13.8.1.2 For that purpose, the on-board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related to the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections 3.13.6.2.1, 3.13.6.3.1 and 3.13.6.4.  
3.13.8.1.3 These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

parabola, each one being based on one of the speed/distance dependent deceleration values (see Figure 38).

# 3.13.8.2 Determination of the supervised targets

3.13.8.2.1 The on-board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the following types of target:

a) the locations corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP (if any), which are in advance of the max safe front end of the train  
b) the Limit of Authority (LOA)  
c) the End of Authority (EOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL)  
d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff Responsible, with a target speed zero

3.13.8.2.1.1 Note: depending on the information received from trackside and the position of the train, the list of supervised targets may be empty.  
3.13.8.2.2 The list of supervised targets shall be re-evaluated when any of the elements it is built of is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on-board, EOA and/or SvL temporarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored information in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)).  
3.13.8.2.3 A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the list of supervised targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the target location.

# 3.13.8.3 Emergency Brake Deceleration curves (EBD)

3.13.8.3.1 If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on-board shall calculate an EBD curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d), that crosses the ceiling speed EBI supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2) at the target location, and that extends up to the location where the target speed is reached (EBD foot).

3.13.8.3.2 If a target is an SvL, the on-board shall calculate an Emergency Brake Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration A-safe(V,d) and that reaches zero speed at the SvL.  
3.13.8.3.3 If a target is the location at the end of the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff Responsible, the on-board shall calculate an Emergency Brake Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d) and that reaches zero speed at this staff responsible end location.

# 3.13.8.5 Guidance curves (GUI)

3.13.8.5.1 The purpose of the guidance curve (GUI) is to provide a comfortable way of braking for the driver, to avoid excessive wear of the brakes and to save traction energy.  
3.13.8.5.2 If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on-board shall calculate a guidance curve (GUI) for each supervised target, based on the normal service brake deceleration A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where the GUI speed is equal to the target speed) shall be:

a) the target location, in case of EOA/SvL  
b) the location defined in 3.13.9.3.5.9, for others targets

# 3.13.9 Supervision limits

# 3.13.9.1 Overview

3.13.9.1.1 In this chapter the following supervision limits are defined:

- Emergency brake intervention (EBI)  
Service brake intervention (SBI)  
- Warning (W)  
- Permitted speed (P)  
- Indication (I)

- Release speed monitoring start location

3.13.9.1.2 The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the train will remain within the various limits (in distance/speed) imposed by the trackside.  
3.13.9.1.3 The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an emergency brake intervention by maintaining the speed of the train within the appropriate limits.

# 3.13.9.2 Ceiling supervision limits

3.13.9.2.1 The ceiling supervision limits are derived from the MRSP elements, where the speed is constant (refer to 3.13.7) or from the LOA.  
3.13.9.2.2 From an MRSP element or from the LOA, the Permitted speed, Warning, Service brake intervention and Emergency brake intervention supervision limits are defined (see Figure 43).

# 3.13.9.3 Braking to target supervision limits

# 3.13.9.3.1 Overview

3.13.9.3.1.1 The braking to target supervision limits are derived from the EBD, SBD and GUI curves.  
3.13.9.3.1.2 From an EBD curve, the Emergency brake intervention (EBI), Service brake intervention (SBI2), Warning (W), Permitted speed (P) and Indication (I) supervision limits, valid for the estimated speed, are defined as follows(see Figure 45):

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/4f93c1fdb1f71ff9671cc44288a492552dc719cae3d7b5fe4e86af872bd96153.jpg)  
Figure 45: Braking to target supervision limits from EBD curve

3.13.9.3.1.3 From the SBD curve, Service brake intervention (SBI1), Warning (W), Permitted speed (P) and Indication (I) supervision limits, valid for the estimated speed, are defined as follows (see Figure 46):

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/c224bcb9dfd468f04afb205c257ba03b33126e477962fc02233893ddab310269.jpg)  
Figure 46: Braking to target supervision limits from SBD curve

3.13.9.3.1.4 No specific supervision limit is calculated from the GUI curve: it is only used to adjust the Permitted speed (P) supervision limit, which is obtained either from the EBD or the SBD curve.

# 3.13.9.3.2 EBI supervision limit

3.13.9.3.2.1 If not inhibited by National Value, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall compensate the inaccuracy of the speed measurement by taking into account the

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

speed under reading amount (V_ura) at the moment when the calculation is made: V delta0 = V_ura (see Figure 45).

3.13.9.3.2.2 The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts:

a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction  
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem

3.13.9.3.2.3 The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows:

a) when the traction cut-off is implemented:

$$
T _ {\text {t r a c t i o n}} = \operatorname {M A X} \left(\left(T _ {\text {t r a c t i o n}} \text {c u t} - \left(T _ {\text {w a r n i n g}} + T _ {\text {b s 2}}\right)\right); 0\right).
$$

b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off

3.13.9.3.2.4 Note: When the traction cut-off is implemented, the traction cut-off command is triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (Twarning + T_bs2) in the equation above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from the EBD.

3.13.9.3.2.5 T_bs2 and Twarning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.4.

3.13.9.3.2.6 The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MAX(T_be - T_traction; 0).

3.13.9.3.2.7 Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless included to make the specifications complete.

3.13.9.3.2.8 During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values.

3.13.9.3.2.9 If  $T_{-}be > T_{-}$  traction, the estimated acceleration during  $T_{-}berem$  (A_est2) shall be the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values between 0 and  $+0.4\mathrm{m / s^2}$ .

3.13.9.3.2.10 The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application of the braking effort is reached shall be derived as follows (see Figure 45):

$$
V _ {b e c} = \max \left\{(V _ {e s t} + V _ {d e l t a 0} + V _ {d e l t a 1}), V _ {t a r g e t} \right\} + V _ {d e l t a 2}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} D _ {b e c} = \max \left\{(V _ {e s t} + V _ {d e l t a 0} + \frac {V _ {d e l t a 1}}{2}), V _ {t a r g e t} \right\} \cdot T _ {t r a c t i o n} \\ + \left(\max \left\{(V _ {e s t} + V _ {d e l t a 0} + V _ {d e l t a 1}), V _ {t a r g e t} \right\} + \frac {V _ {d e l t a 2}}{2}\right) \cdot T _ {b e r e m} \\ \end{array}
$$

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

with  $V_{\text{delta0}} = V_{\text{ura}}$  or  $V_{\text{delta0}} = 0$  (if compensation of speed inaccuracy is inhibited by National Value)

with  $V_{\text{delta}} = A_{\text{est1}} \cdot T_{\text{traction}}$  and  $V_{\text{delta2}} = A_{\text{est2}} \cdot T_{\text{berem}}$

3.13.9.3.2.11 Note: The formula avoids that V_bec is lower than V_target.  
3.13.9.3.2.12 For the estimated speed V_est, the location of the EBI supervision limit shall be:

$$
d _ {E B I} (V _ {e s t}) = d _ {E B D} (V _ {b e c}) - D _ {b e c}
$$

# 3.13.9.3.3 SBI supervision limit

3.13.9.3.3.1 For the EOA, the on-board shall calculate the location of the SBI supervision limit (SBI1) valid for the estimated speed, assuming that this latter remains constant during the interval T_bs1, until the SBD curve is reached.

$$
d _ {S B I 1} \left(V _ {e s t}\right) = d _ {S B D} \left(V _ {e s t}\right) - V _ {e s t} \cdot T _ {b s 1}
$$

3.13.9.3.3.2 For an EBD based target, the on-board shall calculate the location of the SBI supervision limit (SBI2) valid for the estimated speed, assuming that this latter remains constant during the interval T_bs2, until the location of the EBI supervision limit is reached.

$$
d _ {S B I 2} \left(V _ {e s t}\right) = d _ {E B I} \left(V _ {e s t}\right) - V _ {e s t} \cdot T _ {b s 2}
$$

3.13.9.3.3.3 If the service brake command is available for use and the service brake feedback is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs.

3.13.9.3.3.4 If both the service brake command and the service brake feedback are available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall by default be set to T_bs. When the service brake is used by the driver in target speed monitoring or release speed monitoring, they shall be reduced and possibly locked to the respective fixed values of 0s and T_bs2.locked, until the ceiling speed monitoring is entered; they are then reset to T_bs (refer to detailed algorithm in Appendix A.3.10).  
3.13.9.3.3.4.1 In case T_bs < T_bs2_locked then T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs2_locked.  
3.13.9.3.3.5 If the service brake command is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be set to zero.  
3.13.9.3.3.6 Note: The values T_bs1 and T_bs2 = 0s are defined to achieve the maximum performance when service brake command is not used.  
3.13.9.3.3.7 For display purpose only, the SBI1 speed for the estimated train front end, shall be calculated as follows (see Figure 47):

$$
V _ {S B I 1} \left(d _ {\text {e s t f r o n t}}\right) = V _ {S B D} \left(d _ {\text {e s t f r o n t}} + V _ {\text {e s t}} \cdot T _ {\text {b s l}}\right)
$$

$$
V _ {S B I 1} (d _ {e s t f r o n t}) = 0 \mathrm {i f} d _ {e s t f r o n t} + V _ {e s t} \cdot T _ {b s 1} \geq d _ {E o A}

Figure 48: Calculation of SBI2 speed displayed to the driver

3.13.9.3.3.8.1 Note: the re-use of the same distance travelled and speed increase between the SBI2 supervision limit and the EBD, as for the estimated speed (see Figure 48), leads to an overestimation/underestimation of the SBI2 speed to be displayed to the driver. This simplification, which avoids the need of an iterated calculation, is however acceptable and necessary since the error made tends to zero when the train reaches the SBI2 supervision limit.

3.13.9.3.5.2 Tdriver is defined as a fixed value (refer to A.3.1).

3.13.9.3.5.3 Note: The reference for the Permitted speed supervision limit is the SBI supervision limit and not the Warning supervision limit. As a result the permitted and warning supervision limits are clearly separated and do not affect each other. In this way it is clear that the warning is not part of the critical performance interval.

3.13.9.3.5.4 In case the calculation of the Guidance curve is enabled, the on-board shall calculate the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit valid for the estimated speed, as follows:

$$

3.13.9.3.5.8 In case the calculation of the GUI curve is enabled, for display purpose only, the P speed related to EBD, shall be calculated for the max safe front end of the train as follows:

$$

3.13.9.3.5.9 In order to determine the reference location of the target distance displayed to the driver, in order to check whether the target is masking another one, and in order to determine the foot of the GUI curve (only if it is enabled) in case of target different from EOA/SvL, the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the target speed, shall be calculated from the EBD, taking into account the following assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to "zero"  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the target speed, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: VDELTA0t = f41(V_target)

3.13.9.3.5.10 To do so, the same formulas defined above with V_est and V delta0 shall be applied, by substituting V_est with V_target and V delta0 with V delta0t.

$$
d _ {E B I} \left(V _ {t \arg e t}\right) = d _ {E B D} \left(V _ {t \arg e t} + V _ {d e l t a 0 t}\right) - \left(V _ {t \arg e t} + V _ {d e l t a 0 t}\right) \cdot \left(T _ {b e r e m} + T _ {t r a c t i o n}\right)
$$

$$
d _ {P} \big (V _ {t \mathrm {a r g} e t} \big) = d _ {E B I} \big (V _ {t \mathrm {a r g} e t} \big) - V _ {t \mathrm {a r g} e t} \cdot \big (T _ {d r i v e r} + T _ {b s 2} \big)
$$

3.13.9.3.5.10.1 Justification: these assumptions are intended to avoid fluctuations of the target distance displayed to the driver. Moreover the foot of the GUI curve may influence the perturbation location, which must be fully predictable for trackside engineering reasons.  
3.13.9.3.5.11 In case a non protected LX start location is supervised as both the EOA and SvL and the stopping in rear of LX is not required, the location of the most restrictive

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the LX speed shall be used in order to determine the location where the supervision of the LX start location is substituted by the supervision of the LX speed (see section 5.16.3).

3.13.9.3.5.12 To calculate this location, the same formulas defined above with V_est shall be applied by substituting V_est with V_LX.

$$
d _ {S B I 1} (V _ {L X}) = d _ {S B D} (V _ {L X}) - V _ {L X} \cdot T _ {b s 1}
$$

$$
d _ {S B I 2} (V _ {L X}) = d _ {E B I} (V _ {L X}) - V _ {L X} \cdot T _ {b s 2}
$$

With

$$
\begin{array}{l} d _ {E B I} (V _ {L X}) = d _ {E B D} (V _ {L X} + V _ {d e l t a 0} + V _ {d e l t a 1} + V _ {d e l t a 2}) - \left(V _ {L X} + V _ {d e l t a 0} + \frac {V _ {d e l t a 1}}{2}\right) \cdot T _ {t r a c t i o n} \\ - \left(V _ {L X} + V _ {d e l t a 0} + V _ {d e l t a 1} + \frac {V _ {d e l t a 2}}{2}\right) \cdot T _ {b e r e m} \\ \end{array}
$$

And with V delta0, V delta1 and V delta2 calculated according to 3.13.9.3.2.10

In case the GUI curve is inhibited:

$$

$$

In case the GUI curve is enabled:

$$
d _ {P} (V _ {L X}) = \min  \left\{\left(d _ {S B I 1} (V _ {L X}) - V _ {L X} \cdot T _ {d r i v e r}\right), d _ {G U I} (V _ {L X}) \right\} _ {\mathrm {i f}}
$$

$$

$$

$$
d _ {S B I 2} (V _ {L X}) - d _ {S B I 1} (V _ {L X}) <   d _ {\max s a f e f r o n t} - d _ {e s t f r o n t}
$$

3.13.9.3.5.12.1 Note: the use of the instantaneous speed under reading amount and acceleration in the calculation of this location avoids a jump of display when the substitution takes place.

# 3.13.9.3.6 Indication supervision limit (I)

3.13.9.3.6.1 The on-board shall calculate the location of the Indication supervision limit valid for the estimated speed, assuming that this latter remains constant during the interval T_indication until the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit is reached.

$$
d _ {I} (V _ {e s t}) = d _ {P} (V _ {e s t}) - V _ {e s t} \cdot T _ {i n d i c a t i o n}
$$

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.9.3.6.2 If the service brake feedback interface is not available for use, then T_indication shall be calculated as follows:

$$
T _ {i n d i c a t i o n} = \max  \left\{\left(0. 8 \cdot T _ {b s}\right), 5 s \right\} + T _ {d r i v e r}
$$

3.13.9.3.6.3 Note: The reduction of T_indication by a factor is intended to improve performance and the feasibility of this reduction is based on experience with real implementations. To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication, giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake.

3.13.9.3.6.4 If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication shall be equal to 5s + T_driver.

# 3.13.9.4 Release speed supervision limits

3.13.9.4.1 The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. The EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I supervision limit associated to the release speed.  
3.13.9.4.2 Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance. The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the EOA to the Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.3 With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:

a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR  
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR  
c) Instruct the on-board to use the national value.

3.13.9.4.4 In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release speed shall be supervised.  
3.13.9.4.5 Note: When the release speed is given as a fixed value from trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopping the train in rear of the Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure manager to set the appropriate release speed with regard to the risk of passing the Supervised Location.  
3.13.9.4.6 The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SBI supervision limit among the SBI1 related to EOA, the SBI2 related to SvL and, when the Release Speed is calculated on-board, the SBI2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), if any, between the

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

Trip location related to the EOA and the SvL, calculated for the Release Speed value, taking into account the following assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to "zero"  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the release speed, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: VDELTA0rs =  $f_{41}(V\_ release)$

3.13.9.4.7 To do so, the same formulas defined above with V_est and V(delta0 shall be applied, by substituting V_est with V_release and V delta0 with V delta0rs.

$$

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.9.4.8.1 In order to calculate in advance the EBI supervision limit at the Trip location related to the EOA, the on-board equipment shall take into account an estimated acceleration set to "zero".

3.13.9.4.8.2 The on-board equipment shall seek for each target referred to in clause 3.13.9.4.8, a release speed value which satisfies the two following inequalities:

$$
A B S \left\{V _ {r e l e a s e} - \left(V _ {E B D} \left(d _ {t r i p E o A} + D _ {b e c}\right) - V _ {d e l t a 0 r s o b}\right) \right\} \leq 1 k m / h
$$

$$
d _ {t r i p E o A} + D _ {b e c} \leq d _ {E B D} \left(V _ {t a r g e t}\right)
$$

With  $V_{delta0rsob} = \max \left\{f_{41}(V_{release}), V_{ura}\right\}$  or  $V_{delta0rsob} = 0$  (if compensation of speed inaccuracy is inhibited by National Value)

With  $D_{bec} = \left(V_{release} + V_{delta0rsob}\right)\cdot \left(T_{traction} + T_{berem}\right)$

With

$$
\begin{array}{l} d _ {t r i p E o A} = d _ {E o A} + \alpha \cdot L _ {a n t e n n a - f r o n t} \\ + \max  \left\{\left(2 \cdot Q _ {l o c a c c \_ r e f B G} + 10 m + 10 \% \cdot d _ {E o A}\right), \left(d _ {\max s a f e f r o n t} - d _ {\min s a f e f r o n t}\right) \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

And with  $\alpha = 1$  if level  $= 1$

$$
\alpha = 0 \text {i f l e v e l} = 2 \text {o r} 3
$$

If no speed value higher than V_target fulfils the above inequalities, then:

$$
V _ {r e l e a s e} = V _ {t \arg e t}
$$

3.13.9.4.8.2.1 Note: The above formulas are intended to prevent the calculated release speed from fluctuating, according to the distance, speed and acceleration measurements. It allows calculating the release speed only once, for a given on-board reference location, unless

- the distance confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based on the assumption that the whole distance between the current on-board reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET-041 odometer performance values and without any update of the on-board reference location, or  
- the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET-041 performance value

Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), the release speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is acceptable from an operational point of view.

3.13.9.4.8.2.2 Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterative algorithm) to compute the release speed is an implementation issue.  
3.13.9.4.9 If the release speed (Figure 52 box 1 gives an example when it is calculated on-board) exceeds the MRSP anywhere in the area (Figure 52 box 2) delimited on one side by the presumed start location of the Release speed monitoring and on the other side by the trip location related to the EOA, the on-board shall use as a fixed release speed (Figure 52 box 4) the most restrictive value of the MRSP (Figure 52 box 3) within this area, and shall re-evaluate the start location of the Release speed monitoring accordingly.

# 3.13.10 Speed and distance monitoring commands

# 3.13.10.1 Introduction

3.13.10.1.1 By comparing the train speed and position to the various supervision limits defined in the previous section, the on-board equipment generates braking commands, traction cut-off commands and relevant information to the driver. The information displayed to the driver is selected according to the following supervision statuses of the speed and distance monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status, Warning status and Intervention status.  
3.13.10.1.2 The following types of speed and distance monitoring are defined:

Ceiling speed monitoring (CSM)  
Target speed monitoring (TSM)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/4f1c5763e4fe8aec9236f84ef6b5b79054eca6af6cfac138581465a098a2cddb.jpg)  
- Release speed monitoring (RSM)  
Figure 53: Different types of speed and distance monitoring

3.13.10.1.3 Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run without the need to brake to a target.  
3.13.10.1.4 Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the train brakes to a target.  
3.13.10.1.5 Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA.

# 3.13.10.2 General requirements

3.13.10.2.1 The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the speed monitoring. This shall be the estimated speed.  
3.13.10.2.2 Once a Train Interface command (traction cut-off, service brake or emergency brake) is triggered, the on-board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is met.  
3.13.10.2.3 If there is no on-board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring), whenever a service brake command is specified, the emergency brake command shall be triggered instead.  
3.13.10.2.4 The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to the requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI supervision limit shall prevail.

3.13.10.2.5 The on-board shall revoke the Intervention status only when no brake command is applied by the speed and distance monitoring function.  
3.13.10.2.6 In level 2/3: Train trip shall be initiated if the on-board equipment detects that the minimum safe front end has passed the EOA/LOA location.  
3.13.10.2.7 In Level 1: Train Trip shall be initiated if the on-board equipment detects that the minimum safe antenna position (calculated by subtracting distance between active Eurovalise antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end position) has passed the EOA/LOA location.  
3.13.10.2.8 In the following sections, the term V_MRSP (together with the derived ceiling supervision limits) refers to the lowest MRSP element encountered between the min safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.

# 3.13.10.3 Requirements for Ceiling speed monitoring

3.13.10.3.1 The on-board equipment shall display the Permitted speed ceiling supervision limit.  
3.13.10.3.2 When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on-board equipment shall display the SBI speed ceiling supervision limit.  
3.13.10.3.3 The on-board shall compare the estimated speed with the ceiling supervision limits defined in section 3.13.9.2 and shall trigger/revoke commands to the train interface (service brake if implemented or emergency brake) and supervision statuses as described in Table 5 and Table 6.

3.13.10.3.4 The on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the different supervision statuses as described in Table 7 (see section 4.6.1 for details about the symbols). This table takes into account the order of precedence between the supervision statuses and the possible updates of the MRSP while in ceiling speed monitoring (e.g. when a TSR is revoked).

Table 7: Transitions between supervision statuses in ceiling speed monitoring

3.13.10.3.5 When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the ceiling speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t1 defined in Table 5 shall be checked in order to determine whether the Normal status applies. If it is not

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

the case, the on-board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Normal status according to Table 7.

3.13.10.3.6 The Indication status is not used in ceiling speed monitoring. However, in case the ceiling speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to Indication, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions from the Indication status, as described in Table 7.  
3.13.10.3.7 In ceiling speed monitoring, only the ceiling supervision limits (described in section 3.13.9.2) are used to determine the commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses displayed to the driver. However the braking to target supervision limits and the release speed supervision limits (described in sections 3.13.9.3 and 3.13.9.4) are also used to determine the locations where the transition to target speed monitoring and to release speed monitoring occur respectively.  
3.13.10.3.8 The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the first Indication location that will be reached by either the max safe or by the estimated train front end. To that effect, the on-board shall compute the remaining distance to the first Indication location as follows:

$$
\mathrm {I f} V _ {e s t} <   V _ {r e l e a s e}
$$

$$
\text {I n d} \quad \text {d i s t a n c e} = d _ {\substack {\text {s t a r t} \\ R S M}} - d _ {\substack {\text {e s t f r o n t}}} \text {i n} \text {c a s e} d _ {\substack {\text {s t a r t} \\ R S M}} = d _ {S B I 1} \left(V _ {\text {r e l e a s e}}\right)

$$

With Target_1, ..., Target_n being EBD based targets whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed

3.13.10.3.8.1 In case no release speed is supervised, the same formulas shall be applied, by substituting V_release with the value 0.  
3.13.10.3.8.2 Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not display any first Indication location information.

3.13.10.3.9 If A_MAXREDADH (see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests the target information as supplementary DMI information, the on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Relevant Displayed Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets as the one whose remaining distance to its Indication supervision limit (as specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1) is the shortest. The indicated distance to the target shall be computed in the same way as for target speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.7, 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.  
3.13.10.3.9.1 Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not display any target information.  
3.13.10.3.10 If A_MAXREDADH (see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests a time to Indication as supplementary DMI information, the on-board equipment shall compute the Time to Indication (TTI) as the time to travel at the estimated speed the remaining distance to the first Indication location (as specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1). The on-board equipment shall inform the driver as long as this time is shorter than a fixed value (refer to A.3.1).  
3.13.10.3.10.1 Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not compute any time to Indication.

# 3.13.10.4 Requirements for Target speed monitoring

3.13.10.4.1 In target speed monitoring, both the ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2 and 3.13.9.3, are used to determine the commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses displayed to the driver.  
3.13.10.4.2 The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Relevant Displayed Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets whose Indication supervision limit is exceeded (i.e. a condition to trigger a supervision status with respect to these targets is met, see table 8 and table 9) and shall be determined according to the following steps:

- Step 0:  $\mathsf{MRDT}_0 =$  the target of which the braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5), calculated for the current position of the train, is the lowest one amongst the concerned targets:

$$
V_{P} = \min \Bigg\{V_{P}(d_{estfront}),V_{P}(d_{\max safefront}),V_{P}(d_{\max safefront}),\ldots ,V_{P}(d_{\max safefront})\\ EOA  SvL T\arg et\_1 T\arg et\_n\Bigg\}
$$

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

with  $V_{P}(d_{estfront})$  taken into account only if  $d_{estfront} > d_{I} \left( V_{est} \right)$ .

with  $V_{P}(d_{\max safefront})$  taken into account only if  $d_{\max safefront} > d_{I}(V_{est})$

with  $V_{P}(d_{\max safefront})$  taken into account only if  $d_{\max safefront} > d_{I} \left( V_{est} \right)$  and  $V_{est} \geq V_{Targ et\_1}$ .

···

with  $V_{P}(d_{\max safefront})$  taken into account only if  $d_{\max safefront} > d_{I} \left( V_{est} \right)$  and  $V_{est} \geq V_{T\arg et\_n}$ .

- Step 1: the on-board equipment shall check whether the MRDT obtained from the previous step  $(\mathrm{MRDT}_0)$  masks any other target(s) remaining in the list of concerned targets, whose target speed is lower than  $\mathrm{MRDT}_0$ . A target is masked by  $\mathrm{MRDT}_0$  if its Indication supervision limit is located in rear of the location of the  $\mathrm{MRDT}_0$ . Permitted speed supervision limit, both at the target speed of  $\mathrm{MRDT}_0$ . It shall be identified using one of the following formulas, where both the Indication supervision limit and the Permitted speed supervision limit are calculated using the same formulas defined above and by substituting V_est with V_target_MRDT_0:

$$
\begin{array}{c} d _ {I} (V _ {t \arg e t}) <   d _ {P} (V _ {t \arg e t}) \\ E O A M R D T _ {0} \end{array} \text {o r} d _ {I} (V _ {t \arg e t}) <   d _ {P} (V _ {t \arg e t})
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c} d  (V _ {t \underset {M R D T _ {0}} {\arg e t}}) <   d  (V _ {t \underset {M R D T _ {0}} {\arg e t}}) \\ \text {o r} \dots \text {o r} d  (V _ {t \underset {M R D T _ {0}} {\arg e t}}) <   d  (V _ {t \underset {M R D T _ {0}} {\arg e t}}) \end{array}
$$

If at least one target is masked by  $\mathsf{MRDT}_0$ , then the MRDT obtained from this step  $(\mathsf{MRDT}_1)$  shall be the masked target with its Indication supervision limit the furthest in rear of the location of the  $\mathsf{MRDT}_0$  Permitted speed supervision limit and the onboard equipment shall go to the next step.

If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by  $\mathsf{MRDT}_0$  or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of concerned targets, then the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e.  $\mathsf{MRDT}_0$ ).

··

- Step n: the on-board shall apply step n-1, substituting  $\mathsf{MRDT}_{\mathsf{n - 2}}$  with  $\mathsf{MRDT}_{\mathsf{n - 1}}$  and checking the list of concerned targets excluding the targets which have been preselected as MRDT in all the previous steps (i.e. from  $\mathsf{MRDT}_0$  to  $\mathsf{MRDT}_{\mathsf{n - 1}}$  inclusive).

3.13.10.4.2.1 Note 1: the above process for the determination of the MRDT ensures that in all circumstances (especially when several targets are close to each other) it is avoided that a target is displayed after its Indication supervision limit has been reached.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.10.4.2.2 Note 2: when entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one target that satisfies the conditions to be selected as MRDT. Afterwards (e.g. due to train braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be selected as MRDT, which however only means that the target previously selected remains the MRDT (see clause 3.13.10.4.5).  
3.13.10.4.2.3 Note 3: if  $\mathsf{MRDT}_{\mathsf{n - 1}}$  is a target at zero speed (e.g. EOA or SvL), then it is always selected as MRDT, i.e. no other target can be selected as MRDT as per step n.  
3.13.10.4.3 The on-board equipment shall display the Permitted speed, according to following formula:

$$
V_{P} = \min_{DMI}\left\{V_{P}(d_{estfront}),V_{P}(d_{\max safefront}),V_{P}(d_{\max safefront}),...,V_{P}(d_{\max safefront}),V_{MRSP}\right\}
$$

With Target_1, ..., Target_n being all the targets from the list of supervised targets

3.13.10.4.4 When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on-board equipment shall display the SBI speed, according to the following formula:

$$
V _ { \begin{array}{c} S B I \\ D M I \end{array} } = \min  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \max  \left\{V _ {S B I I} \left(d _ {e s t f r o n t}\right), V _ {r e l e a s e} \right\}, \max  \left\{V _ {S B I 2} \left(d _ {\text {m a x s a f e f r o n t}}\right), V _ {r e l e a s e} \right\}, \\ V _ {S B I 2} \left(d _ {\text {m a x s a f e f r o n t}}\right),..., V _ {S B I 2} \left(d _ {\text {m a x s a f e f r o n t}}\right), V _ {M R S P} + d V _ {s b i} \left(V _ {M R S P}\right) \end{array} \right\}
$$

3.13.10.4.5 Once a target is the MRDT, it shall remain the MRDT until it is removed from the list of supervised targets or until it is replaced as MRDT with another target which is selected for the first time according to clause 3.13.10.4.2. The driver shall be informed upon any change of MRDT.  
3.13.10.4.6 If the MRDT is either the EOA or the SvL, the on-board equipment shall display the release speed, if given by the trackside or calculated on-board.  
3.13.10.4.7 If the MRDT is neither the EOA nor the SvL, the indicated distance to the target shall be the distance between the maximum safe front end and the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit calculated for the target speed (see section 3.13.9.3.5 for the calculation of this location), but limited to zero after this location is passed.

Target distance =  $\max \left\{\left(d_{P}\left(V_{t_{\text{arg}}et}\right) - d_{\max safefront}\right),0\right\}$  
3.13.10.4.7.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.13.10.4.8 If the MRDT is either the EOA or the SvL, the indicated distance to the target shall be calculated as follows:

Target distance =  $\max \left\{\min \left\{\left(d_{EOA} - d_{estfront}\right),\left(d_{SvL} - d_{\max safefront}\right)\right\},0\right\}$

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.10.4.8.1 As long as the displayed values are locked due to SB feedback (see Appendix A.3.10 for details), the on-board equipment shall ensure that the displayed Permitted speed, the displayed SBI speed (if any) and the distance to target never increase (e.g. due to the reduction of T_bs1 and T_bs2 or e.g. due to relocation). In other terms if a concerned displayed value (VP_DMI, VSBI_DMI or target distance) calculated as above has a higher value than the previously displayed value, then the previous value shall remain displayed until a further calculated value is lower than the displayed one.  
3.13.10.4.9 The on-board shall consider the service brake command as available for use unless:

a) The service brake command is not implemented, OR  
b) The national value inhibits its use.

Table 11: Revocation of Train Interface commands and supervision statuses in target speed monitoring, EOA/SvL with release speed

3.13.10.4.11 Note: For clarity reasons, the Figures 54 and 55 show the train speed/position in a region where the target speed monitoring may not have been entered yet, further to the crossing of an Indication supervision limit.

3.13.10.4.12 Note: Figure 55 shows the parts of the ceiling speed and braking to target supervision limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to trigger the brake commands and the transitions between supervision statuses. It does not show what is displayed to the driver: in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is displayed (even if not supervised) for values lower than the release speed.  
3.13.10.4.13 In case of target EOA/SvL without any supervised release speed, the Table 9 and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting V_release with the value 0.  
3.13.10.4.13.1 In case the target is the location at the end of the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff Responsible, the Table 9 and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting V_release with the value 0, SvL with staff responsible end location and by ignoring any formula related to EOA.  
3.13.10.4.14 A TI command shall be triggered if a corresponding triggering condition is met for at least one target. On the other hand it shall be revoked only if a corresponding revocation condition is met for each supervised target.  
3.13.10.4.15 The on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the different supervision statuses as described in Table 12 (see section 4.6.1 for details about the symbols). A triggering condition shall be taken into account as soon as it is satisfied for any target. On the other hand a transition from Overspeed, Warning or Intervention status to the Indication status shall be made only if a revocation condition specified for the concerned transition is met for each supervised target.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.10.4.16 When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the target speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t3 defined in Table 8 or Table 9 shall be checked for each target in order to determine whether the Indication status applies. If it is not the case, the on-board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Indication status according to clause 3.13.10.4.15.  
3.13.10.4.17 The Normal status is not used in target speed monitoring. However, in case the target speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to Normal, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions from the Normal status, as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.15.  
3.13.10.4.18 Note: Depending upon train speed/position it is possible that for some target(s) none of the triggering conditions specified in table 8 and 9 is met. However the conditions to enter the target speed monitoring are such (see condition [1] in table 16) that the clauses 3.13.10.4.16 and 3.13.10.4.17 always allow determining a supervision status.

# 3.13.10.5 Requirements for release speed monitoring

3.13.10.5.1 The on-board equipment shall display the Release speed.  
3.13.10.5.2 The on-board equipment shall display the target distance in the same way as for target speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.  
3.13.10.5.3 The braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to the MRDT (i.e. EOA or SvL), as calculated in target speed monitoring from the EBD or SBD, shall also be displayed in the same way as for target speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.3 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.  
3.13.10.5.4 The on-board equipment shall compare the estimated speed with the release speed and shall trigger/revoke commands to the train interface (emergency brake) and supervision statuses as described in Table 13 and Table 14.

Table 15: Transitions between supervision statuses in release speed monitoring

3.13.10.5.6 When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the release speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t1 defined in Table 13 shall be checked in order to determine whether the Indication status applies. If it is not the case, the on-board shall immediately set the supervision status to the Intervention status, applying a transition from the Indication status according to Table 15.  
3.13.10.5.7 The Normal, Warning and Overspeed statuses are not used in release speed monitoring. However, in case the release speed monitoring is entered and the

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

supervision status was previously set to Normal, Warning or Overspeed, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions from respectively the Normal, Warning or Overspeed status, as described in Table 15.

# 3.13.10.6 Transitions between types of Speed and distance monitoring

3.13.10.6.1 The transitions between the Ceiling speed monitoring, the Target speed monitoring and the Release speed monitoring shall be achieved as described in the Table 16:

Table 16: Transitions between types of Speed and distance monitoring

3.13.10.6.2 If a transition of speed and distance monitoring occurs while a brake command is already applied, the concerned command shall be maintained until the revocation condition, if specified for the newly entered speed and distance monitoring, is fulfilled.  
3.13.10.6.2.1 Note: This means that when the service brake is commanded in ceiling speed monitoring while it is not available in target speed monitoring, the service brake remains commanded when the on-board switches to target speed monitoring and is only revoked when the Permitted speed supervision limit is no longer exceeded.  
3.13.10.6.3 If a transition from target speed monitoring to ceiling speed or release speed monitoring occurs while a traction cut-off command is already applied, the traction cut-off command shall be immediately revoked.  
3.13.10.6.4 If a transition from target speed monitoring to release speed monitoring occurs while a service brake command is already applied, the service brake command shall be immediately revoked.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.13.10.6.5 On executing a transition between types of speed and distance monitoring, the supervision status shall be determined according to the requirements specified for the newly entered speed and distance monitoring.

# 3.13.11 Perturbation location

3.13.11.1 The purpose of the perturbation location is to trigger the MA request to the RBC in order to renew the Movement Authority in due time before the train would have to brake to an EOA/SvL or LOA target.  
3.13.11.2 For the SvL or the LOA, the on-board shall calculate the perturbation location as follows.  
3.13.11.3 Starting from the first element of the MRSP (i.e. from the start location of the on-board stored track description), the on-board shall calculate the location of the Indication supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the following assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to "zero"  
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed measurement shall be set to a value, calculated from the speed of the MRSP element, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: VDELTA0ind =  $f_{41}(\text{V\_MRSP - n})$  
c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have any effect: T_bs1ind and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use, otherwise they shall be set to "zero". T_tractionind and T_beremind shall be defined as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem by substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind

3.13.11.4 To calculate the EBI supervision limit, the same formulas defined above with V_est, T_traction, T_berem and V delta0 shall be applied, by substituting V_est with V_MRSP-n, T_traction with T_tractionind, T_berem with T_beremind and V delta0 with V delta0ind.

$$
d _ {E B I} \left(V _ {M R S P - n}\right) = d _ {E B D} \left(V _ {M R S P - n} + V _ {d e l t a 0 i n d}\right) - \left(V _ {M R S P - n} + V _ {d e l t a 0 i n d}\right) \cdot \left(T _ {b e r e m i n d} + T _ {t r a c t i o n i n d}\right)
$$

$$

$$

$$
d _ {I} \left(V _ {M R S P - n}\right) = d _ {P} \left(V _ {M R S P - n}\right) - V _ {M R S P - n} \cdot T _ {\text {i n d i c a t i o n}}
$$

With  $d_{P}\big(V_{MRSP - n}\big) = d_{SBI2}\big(V_{MRSP - n}\big) - V_{MRSP - n} \cdot T_{driver}$  if the GUI curve is inhibited

$\operatorname{Or} d_{P}\left(V_{MRSP-n}\right)=\min \left\{\left(d_{SBI2}\left(V_{MRSP-n}\right)-V_{MRSP-n}\cdot T_{driver}\right), d_{GUI}\left(V_{MRSP-n}\right)\right\}$  if the GUI curve is enabled

3.13.11.5 If the Indication supervision limit, obtained from the speed of the  $n^{\text{th}}$  element, is located between the start and end locations of this  $n^{\text{th}}$  element, the perturbation location shall be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {I f} d _ {M R S P - n} ^ {a} <   d _ {I} \left(V _ {M R S P - n}\right) \leq d _ {M R S P - n} ^ {b} \\ \text {T h e n} d _ {\text {p e r t u r b a t i o n}} = d _ {I} \left(V _ {\text {M R S P -} n}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

3.13.11.6 If the Indication supervision limit, obtained from the speed of the  $n^{\text{th}}$  element, is located in advance of the end location of this  $n^{\text{th}}$  element, and if the Indication supervision limit, obtained from the speed of the  $n + 1^{\text{th}}$  element is located in rear of the end location of this  $n^{\text{th}}$  element (see Figure 56), the perturbation location shall be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} d _ {I} \left(V _ {M R S P - n}\right) > d _ {M R S P - n} ^ {b} \text {a n d} d _ {I} \left(V _ {M R S P - n + 1}\right) <   d _ {M R S P - n} ^ {b} \\ \text {T h e n} d _ {\text {p e r t u r b a t i o n}} = d _ {M R S P - n} ^ {b} \\ \end{array}

Figure 56: Perturbation location derived from MRSP speed increase

3.13.11.7 For the EOA, the on-board shall calculate its perturbation location in the same way as for an EBD based target, except that the formulas to calculate the distance between the location of the Indication supervision limit and the SBD shall be:

$$
d _ {S B I 1} \big (V _ {M R S P - n} \big) = d _ {S B D} \big (V _ {M R S P - n} \big) - V _ {M R S P - n} \cdot T _ {b s 1 i n d}
$$

$$
d _ {I} \big (V _ {M R S P - n} \big) = d _ {P} \big (V _ {M R S P - n} \big) - V _ {M R S P - n} \cdot T _ {i n d i c a t i o n}
$$

With  $d_{P}\big(V_{MRSP - n}\big) = d_{SBI1}\big(V_{MRSP - n}\big) - V_{MRSP - n} \cdot T_{driver}$  if the GUI curve is inhibited  
$\operatorname{Or} d_{P}\left(V_{MRSP-n}\right) = \min \left\{\left(d_{SBI1}\left(V_{MRSP-n}\right) - V_{MRSP-n}\cdot T_{driver}\right),d_{GUI}\left(V_{MRSP-n}\right)\right\}$  if the GUI curve is enabled  
3.13.11.8 The on-board shall trigger the MA request to the RBC when the train has passed, either with its estimated front end for the perturbation location calculated from the EOA

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

or with its max safe front end for the perturbation location calculated from the SvL or the LOA, the following location:

$$
d _ {M A R} = d _ {p e r t u r b a t i o n} - (V _ {M R S P} + d V _ {w a r n i n g} (V _ {M R S P})) \cdot T _ {M A R}.
$$

3.13.11.9 If, in exceptional situation (e.g. after a shortening of MA), the EBD, SBD or GUI speed at the start location of the MRSP is lower than the speed of the first element of the MRSP, the location to trigger the MA request to the RBC shall be considered as already passed.  
3.13.11.10 Note: For trackside engineering reasons, the assumptions for the calculation of the EBI supervision limit are necessary to obtain a fully predictable perturbation location, i.e. independent from the measured acceleration and speed confidence interval.

# 3.14 Brake Command Handling and Protection against Undesirable Train Movement

# 3.14.1 Brake Command Handling

3.14.1.1 Note: Whenever the type of brake used is not specified explicitly in the text, it shall be interpreted as not being important for technical interoperability and being a property of the specific implementation.  
3.14.1.2 In case only the application of (the non-vital) service brake has been commanded and the service brake fails to be applied, the emergency brake command shall be given.  
3.14.1.3 If the emergency brake command was triggered due to a trip condition (see chapter 4) the emergency brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement of the trip condition.  
3.14.1.4 For handling of brake commands resulting from the speed and distance monitoring, refer to section 3.13.10.  
3.14.1.5 If the brake command was triggered due to roll away protection, reverse movement protection or standstill supervision the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.6 If the brake command was triggered due to linking error, balise group message inconsistency or RAMS related supervision error, the brake command shall be released at standstill.  
3.14.1.7 If the brake command was triggered due to supervision of the safe radio connection (T_NVCONTACT) the brake command shall be released at standstill or if a new consistent message has been received from the RBC.  
3.14.1.7.1 If the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed reversing distance related to a reversing area or due to any further movement in the direction opposite to the train

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

orientation while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the brake command shall be released if the reversing distance becomes extended so that the reversing distance is no longer overpassed, or at standstill after driver acknowledgement.

3.14.1.7.2 If the brake command was triggered due to change of Train Data while running (see section 5.17 procedure "Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver"), the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.7.3 If the brake command was triggered due to the detection of a train movement while modifying/revalidating train data or while entering SR speed/distance limits, the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement..  
3.14.1.7.4 If the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed distance allowed for moving backwards in Post Trip mode or due to any further movement in the direction opposite to the train orientation while the distance allowed for moving backwards in Post Trip mode is still overpassed, the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement.  
3.14.1.7.5 If the brake command was triggered due to the driver not having acknowledged a text message, the brake command shall be released after the driver has acknowledged the text message.  
3.14.1.8 An indication shall be given to the driver to indicate when the brakes can be released and when an acknowledgement is requested.

# 3.14.2 Roll Away Protection

3.14.2.1 Note: This protection is only applicable if the required information can be obtained from the direction controller.  
3.14.2.2 The Roll Away Protection (RAP) shall prevent the train from moving in a direction, which conflicts with the current position of the direction controller in the active desk.  
3.14.2.3 If the controller is in neutral position, the RAP shall prevent forward and reverse movements of the train.  
3.14.2.4 When the system recognises a movement exceeding the national value for the allowed roll away distance the brakes shall be triggered.  
3.14.2.5 Refer to section 3.14.1.  
3.14.2.6 An indication shall be given to the driver showing when the RAP is commanding the brakes.  
3.14.2.7 After revocation of the brake command the RAP shall be re-initialised using the current position of the train as the new reference location.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 3.14.3 Reverse Movement Protection

3.14.3.1 The Reverse Movement Protection (RMP) shall prevent the train from moving in the opposite direction to the permitted one. The permitted movement direction of a train shall be the one of the currently valid MA, if available on-board. See chapter 4 concerning permitted direction for special cases.

3.14.3.2 When a reverse movement is detected, the brake command shall be triggered after a distance specified by the national value.

3.14.3.3 Refer to section 3.14.1.

3.14.3.4 An indication shall be given to the driver showing when the RMP is commanding the brakes.

3.14.3.5 After revocation of the brake command the RMP shall be reinitialised using the current position of the train as the new reference location.

3.14.3.6 Information received from balises during reverse movement shall be ignored.

# 3.14.4 Standstill supervision

3.14.4.1 This function shall prevent the train from moving.  
3.14.4.2 When a movement is detected, the brake command shall be triggered after a distance specified by the national value.  
3.14.4.3 Refer to section 3.14.1.  
3.14.4.4 After revocation of the brake command the standstill supervision shall be re-initialised.  
3.14.4.5 If a cab is active, an indication shall be given to the driver showing when the Standstill Supervision is commanding the brakes.

# 3.15.1 RBC/RBC Handover

# 3.15.1.1 Introduction

3.15.1.1.1 The RBC/RBC Handover principles are such that trains are able to pass from one RBC area to another automatically (without driver action).  
3.15.1.1.2 This is also granted when, due to a failure in the on-board radio communication system, the on-board is no longer able to manage two communication sessions at once. Thereby, the behaviour of the RBCs is independent from such on-board degraded situation.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.15.1.1.3 However, an RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one communication session available may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to "prepare" (session establishment, version determination, ...) the expected supervision by the Accepting RBC until the on-board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.1.4 In level 3, trains following the one with only one communication session available will always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from the disconnection from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting RBC.

# 3.15.1.2 Handing Over RBC

3.15.1.2.1 When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another RBC area, it shall send:

a) Intentionally deleted.  
b) To the Accepting RBC the following information:

- The ETCS identity of the on-board equipment;  
- The border location that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting RBC area;  
- Current mode of the on-board equipment;  
- For a leading engine, Train Data and Train Running Number;  
- The system versions supported by the on-board equipment;  
- Optionally, for a non-leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine.

3.15.1.2.2 The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on-board equipment concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding information from the Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.2.3 It shall be possible for the Handing Over RBC to request route related information from the Accepting RBC, limited to a maximum amount of data.

3.15.1.2.3.1 Route related information is :

a) Movement authorities  
b) Linking  
c) International static speed profiles  
d) Axle Load Speed profiles  
e) Gradients  
f) Temporary speed restrictions  
g) Mode profiles  
h) Intentionally deleted  
i) Track Conditions

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

j) Level Transition orders  
k) Intentionally deleted  
I) Route Suitability Data  
m) National Values  
n) Adhesion Factor  
o) Level Crossings  
p) Permitted Braking Distance Information

3.15.1.2.3.2 Note: The amount of information to be sent between the RBCs is depending on the implementation trackside.  
3.15.1.2.4 Note: Route related information received from the Accepting RBC will be processed by the Handing Over RBC if possible.  
3.15.1.2.5 Deleted.  
3.15.1.2.6 When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border location, it shall inform the Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.2.6.1 Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting RBC that the train has entered the Accepting RBC area.  
3.15.1.2.7 When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the minimum safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, it shall send a disconnection order to the on-board equipment.  
3.15.1.2.8 When the Accepting RBC informs the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility, the latter shall stop sending route related information to the on-board equipment.  
3.15.1.2.9 When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to be cancelled, it shall send this cancellation information to the Accepting RBC (including the train identification).  
3.15.1.2.9.1 Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:

- Change to a route which does no more include the border;  
- The sending of an "end of mission" information from the on-board equipment.

# 3.15.1.3 On-board equipment

3.15.1.3.1 When receiving an order to switch to another RBC at a given location, the on-board equipment shall:

a) Establish the communication session with the Accepting RBC;

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the maximum safe front end of the train passes the given location;  
c) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the minimum safe rear end of the train passes the given location;

3.15.1.3.2 Exception to 3.15.1.3.1 a) (degraded situation): If the on-board equipment is able to handle only one communication session at a given time, it shall wait until the session with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the border and then establish the session with the Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.3.3 As soon as the on-board equipment has established the session with the Accepting RBC, it shall send its Train Data unless it is in sleeping or non leading mode.  
3.15.1.3.4 When the on-board equipment is connected to both RBCs, it shall send its position reports to both of them with the use of the position report parameters valid for the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.3.4.1 If the on-board equipment is connected to both RBCs, and it executes an End of Mission, it shall execute the End of Mission procedure with both RBCs  
3.15.1.3.5 As soon as the on-board sends a position report directly to the Accepting RBC with its maximum safe front end having passed the border, it shall use information received from the Accepting RBC and only a disconnection order shall be accepted from the Handing Over RBC.  
3.15.1.3.5.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.15.1.3.6 While both communication sessions are opened, if information is received from the Accepting RBC before a position report is sent to the Accepting RBC with the maximum safe front end having passed the border, this information shall be stored on-board.

Exception: The acknowledgement of Train Data shall be immediately accepted by the on-board equipment.

3.15.1.3.6.1 Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to Chapter 4 Use of received information.  
3.15.1.3.7 When the train front end passes the announced border or when an order to execute the RBC transition immediately is received, the on-board shall substitute the current valid RBC ID/phone number with those of the Accepting RBC.  
3.15.1.3.8 After this substitution, the on-board shall however retain the RBC ID/phone number of the Handing Over RBC until at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

a) Min safe rear end of the train has passed the border and the communication session with this Handing Over RBC has been terminated,  
b) The RBC transition order is deleted according to A.3.4 or 4.10.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.15.1.3.8.1 Note: Even after the train front end has passed the border, the on-board may have to maintain the communication session with the Handing Over RBC (see 3.5.4) or re-establish it (see 3.5.3.4 f)) and needs therefore to remember the RBC ID/phone number of this RBC.  
3.15.1.3.9 In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has reported that the train has passed with its min safe rear end the announced border and no order to terminate the session is received from the Handing Over RBC within a fixed waiting time (see Appendix A.3.1) from the time the position report was sent, it shall repeatedly send a position report with the fixed waiting time after each repetition, until the order to terminate the session is received, or the defined number of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication session with the Handing Over RBC.

# 3.15.1.4 Accepting RBC

3.15.1.4.1 The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions.  
3.15.1.4.2 As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on-board equipment a position report and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility.  
3.15.1.4.3 When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on-board equipment and the Handing over RBC Train Data provided by the on-board equipment shall take precedence.  
3.15.1.4.4 If the Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Handing Over RBC, it shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding onboard equipment (if already established).  
3.15.1.4.5 The Accepting RBC shall comply with the maximum amount of data contained in the last received route related information request from the Handing Over RBC.

# 3.15.1.5 RBC/RBC message acknowledgement

3.15.1.5.1 As soon as a consistent RBC/RBC message including the request for acknowledgement is received, the receiving RBC shall send an acknowledgement to the emitting RBC.  
3.15.1.5.2 The RBC/RBC message is consistent when all checks have been completed successfully:

a) It has passed the checks performed by the RBC/RBC Safe Communication Interface protocol (see SUBSET-098);  
b) Variables in the message do not have invalid values.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.15.1.5.3 The acknowledgement message shall refer to the identity of the concerned message sent by the emitting RBC.

# 3.15.2 Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines

3.15.2.1 It is possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being under the control of a driver.  
3.15.2.2 Only the leading engine is responsible for the train movement supervision functions.

# 3.15.3 Splitting/joining

3.15.3.1 ERTMS/ETCS allows Splitting and Joining using the normal supervision functions available (e.g. On-sight, Shunting).  
3.15.3.2 Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment each.  
3.15.3.2.1 Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures.  
3.15.3.3 ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect).  
3.15.3.4 Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining requires the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation has been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection).

# 3.15.4 Reversing of movement direction

3.15.4.1 It shall be possible to send in advance to an on-board equipment information about areas, where initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible, i.e. change the direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.  
3.15.4.1.1 A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available on-board.  
3.15.4.2 Together with start and end of reversing area, the following supervision information shall be sent:

a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area where reversing of movement is permitted with which the maximum distance information is sent.  
b) Reversing mode speed limit allowed during reverse movement.

Figure 57: Reversing area and maximum distance to run

3.15.4.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use as fixed reference location for reversing distance the end location of the reversing area with which the maximum distance information is received. This fixed reference location shall remain unchanged until a new reversing area is received.  
3.15.4.2.1.1 Example 1: If a closer SvL is defined, see Appendix A.3.4 for a complete list of situations, the reversing area is deleted beyond the new SvL. The reference location for the distance to run in the direction opposite to the reversing area remains fixed at its original position.  
3.15.4.2.1.2 Example 2: the fixed reference location remains also unchanged in case of update of distance to run in reverse movement without receiving a new reversing area.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/3d3b3766924b3f6f493aaff65adf51d03bacac90d31b03422db64351c9471760.jpg)

3.15.4.2.2 Note: All locations refer to the estimated front end of the train (refer to clause 3.6.4.6).  
3.15.4.3 New distance to run and Reversing mode speed limit given from the trackside shall replace the one already available on-board.  
3.15.4.3.1 Intentionally deleted.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.15.4.4 While at standstill with the front end of the train inside the indicated area, it shall be possible for the driver to reverse the direction of movement.  
3.15.4.5 The on-board equipment shall allow movement in the direction opposite to the train orientation, supervising it according to distance and speed received.  
3.15.4.6 Note: level transitions and RBC/RBC handovers are not handled by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment when in Reversing mode.  
3.15.4.7 When at standstill the on-board equipment shall inform the driver if the reversing of movement is permitted.  
3.15.4.8 If the end location of the maximum distance to run in the opposite direction is passed by the train front end, the emergency brake command shall be triggered.

# 3.15.5 Track ahead free

3.15.5.1 In a level 2/3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is able to handle a track ahead free request given by the RBC.  
3.15.5.2 The track ahead free request from the RBC shall indicate to the on-board

a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall begin to display the request to the driver.  
b) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop to display the request to the driver (in case the driver did not acknowledge).

3.15.5.3 As long as it is displayed, the driver has the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead free request (meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train and the next signal or board marking signal position is free).  
3.15.5.4 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free.  
3.15.5.5 There is no restrictive consequence by the on-board system if the driver does not acknowledge.  
3.15.5.6 A new track ahead free request shall replace the one previously received and stored.

# 3.15.6 Handling of National Systems

3.15.6.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board supports driving on national infrastructure under the supervision of National Systems.  
3.15.6.2 In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is interfaced to a National System through an STM, refer to Subset 035 for detailed requirements.  
3.15.6.2.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.15.6.3 Intentionally deleted.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.15.6.4 Intentionally deleted.  
3.15.6.5 Amongst the data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS that can be transmitted by trackside over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels, it shall be possible to send from balises or RBC data to be forwarded to a National System.  
3.15.6.5.1 Note: Definition of what qualifies as "data to be forwarded to a National System" is national dependent and outside the scope of Subset 026.

# 3.15.7 Tolerance of Big Metal Mass

3.15.7.1 Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as defined in Subset-036, section 6.5.2 "Metal Masses in the Track" may trigger an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function.  
3.15.7.2 In Levels 0/NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored for a defined distance (see A.3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction.  
3.15.7.3 Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all excessive big metal masses with track condition "Big Metal Mass" outside ETCS fitted areas.

# 3.15.8 Cold Movement Detection

3.15.8.1 After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours.  
3.15.8.2 When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, if available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the status of information stored by on-board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for details).  
3.15.8.3 Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as not available if:

a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment, OR  
b) the Cold Movement Detection function has encountered a condition, during the No Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement information (e.g. the battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No Power period).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 3.15.9 Virtual Balise Cover

3.15.9.1 It shall be possible to set and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC). A VBC is defined by:

a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on-board together with the area (country or region) in which the VBC is applicable. The VBC marker and the country/region identity form the unique VBC identity.  
b) Its validity period.

3.15.9.2 During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to remove an existing one.  
3.15.9.3 As long as a VBC is stored on-board:

a) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ignore any balise telegram that includes a VBC marker and a country/region identity that both match the VBC identity.  
b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise telegram occur.

3.15.9.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives from balise or from driver a new VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace the previous one, including its validity period.  
3.15.9.5 A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on-board equipment is switched off (i.e. enters No Power mode) and shall remain applicable when powered on again. It shall be deleted when:

a) it is ordered by trackside, or  
b) its validity period has elapsed, or  
c) it is removed by the driver (during Start of Mission), or  
d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from a balise group and the country/region identity of the VBC. Note: this means that the reception of a consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting a VBC due to mismatching country/region identities.

# 3.15.10 Advance display of route related information

3.15.10.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display an overview of the gradient profile (as received from trackside), of the MRSP, of the track conditions (except the tunnel stopping areas), of the first Indication location, if any (only in Ceiling Speed monitoring), and of the EOA/LOA, with the remaining distances referred to the train front end position.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.15.10.2 With regards to the MRSP, the track conditions and the EOA/LOA, the remaining distances shall be computed taking into account the min safe, the estimated or the max safe train front end position depending on their respective supervision.  
3.15.10.3 With regards to the gradient profile, the remaining distances shall be computed taking into account the estimated train front end position.  
3.15.10.3.1 With regards to the first Indication location, the remaining distance shall be computed as specified in clauses 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1.  
3.15.10.4 The overview of route related information shall be restricted to the elements contained within the movement authority and up to the first target at zero speed, if any.

# 3.16 Data Consistency

# 3.16.1 Criteria of consistency

3.16.1.1 The on-board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the following criteria is not fulfilled.

a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid values  
b) The message shall be received in due time.  
c) The message shall be received at the right expected location.

3.16.1.1.1 Regarding a): a value of a variable is invalid when a spare value is used.

# 3.16.2 Balises

# 3.16.2.1 Definitions

3.16.2.1.1 The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram.

3.16.2.1.2 The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a balise group is called a balise group message.

3.16.2.1.2.1 Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message coincide.

3.16.2.1.3 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.16.2.2 General

3.16.2.2.1 If the on-board is not able to recognise whether a balise group is linked or unlinked (if none of the balises in the balise group can be read correctly), it shall consider it as unlinked.

3.16.2.2.2 A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

a) No balise is found within the maximum distance between balises from the previous balise in the group.  
or  
b) A following balise within the group has been passed.

# 3.16.2.3 Linking Consistency

3.16.2.3.1 If linking information is used the on-board shall react according to the linking reaction information in the following cases:

a) If the location reference of the expected balise group is found in rear of the expectation window  
b) If the location reference of the expected balise group is not found inside the expectation window (i.e. the end of the expectation window has been reached without having found the expected balise group)  
c) If inside the expectation window of the expected balise group another announced balise group, expected later, is found.

3.16.2.3.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall reject the message from a balise group found with its location reference outside its expectation window.  
3.16.2.3.2 The on-board shall reject the message from the expected group and trip the train if the balise group is passed in the unexpected direction.  
3.16.2.3.2.1 Exception: When the expected balise group is referred in the linking information with a balise group with ID "unknown", 3.4.4.4.2.1 shall apply.  
3.16.2.3.3 If the location reference balise of the group is duplicated and the on-board is only able to correctly evaluate the duplicating one, the duplicating one shall be used as location reference instead.  
3.16.2.3.4 If the balise duplicating the location reference balise is used as location reference for the group, and is found within the expectation window, no linking reaction shall be applied.

# 3.16.2.4 Balise Group Message Consistency

3.16.2.4.1 If linking information is used, the on-board shall reject the message from a linked balise group found in the expected location and react according to the linking reaction in the following cases:

a) A balise is missed inside the group.  
b) A balise is detected but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC,...).  
c) Variables in the balise group message have invalid values.  
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.16.2.4.2 Exception: Concerning a) and b) above, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not reject the message and shall not apply the linking reaction if the balise not found, or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group and the duplicating one is correctly read.  
3.16.2.4.3 If linking information is used, the on-board shall reject the message from a balise group marked as linked but not included in the linking information. No reaction shall be applied, even if errors in the reading of the balise group occur.  
3.16.2.4.4 If no linking information is used, the on-board shall reject the message from a balise group marked as linked and command application of the service brake in the following cases:

a) A balise is missed inside the group.  
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC).  
c) Variables in the balise group message have invalid values.  
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)

3.16.2.4.4.1 Exceptions: Concerning a) and b) of clause 3.16.2.4.4, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment:

a) shall not reject the message and shall not command application of the service brake if the balise not found, or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group, the duplicating one is correctly read and contains:

- directional information while the orientation of the balise group can still be evaluated, or  
only information valid for both directions, or  
- neither directional information nor information valid for both directions, or  
- only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS, or  
- only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS together with other information valid for both directions.

b) shall not command application of the service brake if the telegram correctly read from another balise of the group contains the information "Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction".

3.16.2.4.4.2 Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the service brake is applied, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position when the train has reached standstill. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened.  
3.16.2.4.4.3 Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the service brake is applied, the driver shall be informed that this is due to a balise group message consistency problem.  
3.16.2.4.5 A message counter shall be attached to each balise telegram indicating which balise group message the telegram fits to.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.16.2.4.6 Instead of a message counter corresponding to a given balise group message, it shall be possible to identify a telegram as always fitting all possible messages of the group.  
3.16.2.4.6.1 It shall also be possible to identify a telegram as never fitting any message of the group.  
3.16.2.4.7 Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message, excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2.4.6 and the ones that are not used by the onboard to compose the message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2), if their values are not all identical, or at least one of them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall be considered as a message consistency error.  
3.16.2.4.7.1 In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall also be considered as a message consistency error.  
3.16.2.4.8 It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU (e.g. the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message or a RIU message including the information "default balise/loop/RIU information".  
3.16.2.4.8.1 If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the on-board includes the information "default balise information", the on-board shall ignore any other information included in this telegram and shall consider information from the telegram not containing "default balise information".  
3.16.2.4.8.2 When duplicated balises are both found and decoded correctly, and both, or none of them, contain "default balise information", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall compose the message using the telegram from the last received balise out of the pair.  
3.16.2.4.9 If a message has been received containing the information "default balise information", the driver shall be informed.

# 3.16.2.5 Unlinked Balise Group Message Consistency

3.16.2.5.1 An on-board equipment shall reject the message received from a balise group marked as unlinked and command application of the service brake in the following cases:

a) A balise is missed inside the unlinked balise group.  
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC).  
c) Variables in the balise group message have invalid values.  
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)

3.16.2.5.1.1 Exceptions: Concerning a) and b) of clause 3.16.2.5.1, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment:

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

a) shall not reject the message and shall not command application of the service brake if the balise not found, or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group, the duplicating one is correctly read and contains:

- directional information while the orientation of the balise group can still be evaluated, or  
only information valid for both directions, or  
- neither directional information nor information valid for both directions, or  
- only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS, or  
- only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS together with other information valid for both directions.

b) shall not command application of the service brake if the telegram correctly read from another balise of the group contains the information "Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction".

3.16.2.5.2 Concerning clause 3.16.2.5.1, if the service brake is applied, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position when the train has reached standstill. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened.  
3.16.2.5.3 Concerning clause 3.16.2.5.1, if the service brake is applied, the driver shall be informed that this is due to a balise group message consistency problem.

# 3.16.2.6 Linking Reactions

3.16.2.6.1 When the linking reaction leads to train trip or a service brake application, the driver shall be informed that the intervention is due to data consistency problem with the expected balise group.  
3.16.2.6.2 If the service brake is initiated due to the linking reaction, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position when the train has reached standstill. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened.

# 3.16.2.7 RAMS related supervision functions

3.16.2.7.1 Mitigation of balise reception degradation  
3.16.2.7.1.1 If 2 consecutive linked balise groups announced by linking are not detected and the end of the expectation window of the second balise group has been passed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall command the service brake and the driver shall be informed. At standstill, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened.  
3.16.2.7.2 Mitigation of balise cross-talk while expecting repositioning information

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.16.2.7.2.1 If repositioning is announced and the expected repositioning balise group has been found, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall keep looking for a balise group that satisfies the same criteria as this previously expected and already found repositioning balise group, until one of the following events occurs:

a) the on-board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise group that was announced and already found  
b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is found.

3.16.2.7.2.2 If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously expected and already found repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the service brake and the driver shall be informed. At standstill, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened.  
3.16.2.7.2.3 Note: this function is independent from linking function, i.e. the rules related to linking always apply. This means that once a repositioning balise group has been found and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment will start expecting the first balise group announced in this new linking information in parallel with the monitoring specified in 3.16.2.7.2.1.

# 3.16.3 Radio

# 3.16.3.1 General issues

3.16.3.1.1 A radio message is consistent when all checks have been completed successfully:

a) Checks performed by Euroradio protocol have been passed (see Subset-037)  
b) Time stamps checks have been passed (see 3.16.3.3.3)  
c) Variables in the messages do not have in-valid values.

3.16.3.1.1.1 The on-board shall reject a message transmitted from the trackside if the message is not consistent.  
3.16.3.1.1.2 The on-board shall inform the trackside if a not consistent message is received.  
3.16.3.1.2 Emergency messages shall be transmitted either as high priority data or as normal priority data.  
3.16.3.1.3 Other messages shall be sent as normal priority data.  
3.16.3.1.3.1 Messages shall only be accepted when received with the data priority for which they are specified.  
3.16.3.1.4 The chapters 3.16.3.2 to 3.16.3.5 define data consistency principles and corresponding checks for data transmitted as normal priority data. For high priority data, the checks shall not apply.

# 3.16.3.2 Time stamping

3.16.3.2.1 The trackside shall always transmit its information with reference to the train time.  
3.16.3.2.2 To time-stamp its messages, the trackside shall make a safe estimation of the on-board time, based on the time-stamp of the received messages and the internal processing times. The estimation shall be made in such a way that the on-board time estimated by the trackside shall not be in advance of the real on-board time.  
3.16.3.2.3 Wrap around of the onboard timer can occur during a communication session and shall have no impact on system behaviour.

# 3.16.3.3 Supervision of Sequence

3.16.3.3.1 The trackside shall time-stamp a message with a value corresponding to the time of sending.  
3.16.3.3.2 There shall always be a time stamp increment between consecutive messages.  
3.16.3.3.3 If the time stamp of the last received message is lower than or equal to the former one its content shall not be used.  
3.16.3.3.3.1 Only time stamps of messages received as normal priority data shall be used.  
3.16.3.3.3.2 Note: The supervision does not detect a lost message. This has to be assured by means of the "acknowledge" function.

# 3.16.3.4 Supervision of safe radio connection

3.16.3.4.1 When the difference between the time stamp of the latest consistent received message and the current on-board time is greater than the T_NVCONTACT parameter (national value), the on-board shall apply the reaction required by trackside (see 3.16.3.4.2).

3.16.3.4.1.1 After the on-board equipment has switched to L2 or 3 with no communication session established, the current onboard time shall be compared with the on-board time at the moment of the level transition (instead of the time stamp of the latest consistent received message) until a new consistent message has been received.  
3.16.3.4.1.2 When an RBC/RBC handover has been announced, the current onboard time shall be compared with the time stamp of the latest consistent message from the Handing over RBC until the train considers the Accepting RBC as the supervising one (refer to 3.15.1.3.5). From then on the current onboard time shall be compared with the time stamp of the latest received consistent message from the Accepting RBC.  
3.16.3.4.1.3 As long as the train front end is inside an announced radio hole, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop the supervision of the safe radio connection. Afterwards, until a new consistent message has been received, the current onboard time shall be compared with the on-board time when the train front end left the radio hole (instead of the time stamp of the latest consistent received message).

a) Train trip  
b) Apply service brake  
c) No reaction

3.16.3.4.3 For all reactions, if no new consistent message has been received after an additional delay time (as defined in A.3.1), the on-board shall release the safe radio connection and then set-up it again (maintaining the communication session).  
3.16.3.4.4 When the reaction leads to train trip or a service brake application, the driver shall be informed that no safe radio message has been received in due time.  
3.16.3.4.5 If the service brake is initiated, the following reaction shall be taken;

a) For brake command release conditions refer to section 3.14.1.7.  
b) If no new consistent message is received until the train reaches standstill, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be shortened.

# 3.17 System Version Management

# 3.17.1 Introduction

3.17.1.1 Definitions, high level principles and rules regarding the offline management of ERTMS/ETCS system version during the ERTMS/ETCS system life time are given in SUBSET-104.  
3.17.1.2 The objective of this section is to define requirements applicable to ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and to trackside constituents, when different versions of the ERTMS/ETCS system have been defined.  
3.17.1.3 Intentionally deleted.

# 3.17.2 Determination of the operated system version

3.17.2.1 The on-board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of the ERTMS/ETCS system version numbers X included in the envelope of legally operated system versions, as defined in chapter 6.  
3.17.2.1.1 Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on-board equipment shall always operate the highest system version number Y defined in this release of the SRS, regardless of the system version number Y transmitted by the trackside.  
3.17.2.2 The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version (refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one introduced in this release of the SRS).  
3.17.2.3 The on-board equipment shall determine the operated system version number X, in relation to non-RBC trackside constituents, as the system version number X transmitted by any balise, loop or RIU, if this system version number X is higher than the currently operated one.  
3.17.2.4 It shall be possible from balise group to order the on-board equipment to operate a system version.  
3.17.2.5 On receiving the order to operate system version from balise group, the on-board equipment shall immediately operate the system version number X given in the order. After the order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any further received balise telegram/loop message or any further contacted RIU.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.17.2.5.1 Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one.  
3.17.2.6 If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a balise/loop and the corresponding identifier(s) for which a set of national values is used onboard, the on-board equipment shall consider the system version number X transmitted by this balise/loop as the operated one and shall comply again with requirement 3.17.2.3.  
3.17.2.7 If the on-board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted by a non-RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it shall consider the operated system version as unchanged.  
3.17.2.8 In case of communication session established with an RBC, the system version number X of the RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation to non-RBC constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the operated system version number X shall be determined according to the following principles:

a) if the on-board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2/3 area), the RBC system version number X shall be operated when the transition to level 2/3 is executed;  
b) if the on-board equipment is in level 2/3 (SoM procedure or order received from trackside), the RBC system version number X shall be operated immediately;  
c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the accepting RBC system version number X shall be operated as soon as the engine has passed the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end;  
d) in case the on-board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.g. exit from a level 2/3 area), the system version control in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again considered;  
e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version control in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again considered.

3.17.2.9 The system version currently operated when the on-board equipment is switched off (i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and re-used when powered on.  
3.17.2.9.1 If the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), the highest supported system version shall be used.

# 3.17.3 Handling of trackside data in relation to system version

3.17.3.1 Every telegram transmitted by a balise, and every message transmitted by Euroloop and Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

allowed for the balise, Euroloop and Radio Infill Unit to transmit data correspondent to several system versions.

3.17.3.2 All messages transmitted by an RBC shall contain data only related to one system version.  
3.17.3.3 The on-board equipment shall check the system version prior to any further checks (data consistency, ..), as they depend on the system version.

3.17.3.4.1 Intentionally deleted.  
3.17.3.4.2 Intentionally deleted.  
3.17.3.5 The on-board equipment shall check the ERTMS/ETCS system version number X transmitted by any balise:

a) In all levels, if this system version number X equals to 0, the balise information shall be ignored.  
b) In all levels, if this system version number X is different from 0 and lower than the lowest system version number X supported by the on-board equipment, it shall be able to interpret the balise information, to the extent defined for each type of information (see chapter 6 for detailed requirements). If the on-board is not able to interpret the information, this shall be considered as a message consistency error.  
c) In all levels, if this system version number X is amongst its supported ones, the onboard equipment shall be able to interpret the balise information. See chapter 6 for detailed requirements.  
d) In levels 1, 2 and 3, if this system version number X is greater than the highest version number X supported by the on-board equipment, the information from this balise shall be ignored, the train shall be tripped and an indication shall be given to the driver.  
e) In levels 0 and NTC, if this system version number X is greater than the highest version number X supported by the on-board equipment, the information from this balise shall be ignored and no reaction shall be applied.

3.17.3.6 In level 1 the on-board equipment shall check the ERTMS/ETCS system version number X transmitted by any Euroloop found:

a) if this system version number X is lower than the lowest system version number X supported by the on-board equipment, it shall be able to interpret the loop information, to the extent defined for each type of information (see chapter 6 for detailed requirements). If the on-board is not able to interpret the information, this shall be considered as a message consistency error.  
b) if this system version number  $X$  is amongst its supported ones, the on-board equipment shall be able to interpret the loop information. See chapter 6 for detailed requirements.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

c) If this system version number X is greater than the highest version number X supported by the on-board equipment, no reaction shall be applied and the information from this loop shall be ignored.  
3.17.3.7 The on-board equipment shall check the ERTMS/ETCS system version number X transmitted the first time any RBC is contacted (including RBC hand over) or any RIU is contacted. Refer to section 3.5.3.7 d) for details.

a) unknown packet included in a balise telegram/loop message related to the higher system version;  
b) unknown radio message from an RBC or RIU operating with the higher system version;  
c) unknown packet from an RBC or RIU operating with the higher system version, included in a message in which one or more optional packet can be added according to the version operated by on-board.

# 3.18 System Data

# 3.18.1 Fixed Values

3.18.1.1 Note: Appendix to chapter 3 contains a list of Fixed values used as system parameters in the supervision. These parameters are system related and can easily be changed in later versions of the ERTMS/ETCS if required. These parameters are not defined as National data.

# 3.18.2 National / Default Values

3.18.2.1 Note: Appendix to chapter 3 contains list of National and Default Values.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.18.2.2 Trains shall be supervised according to the National Values of the current infrastructure if they are available on-board.  
3.18.2.3 National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are applicable. They shall become applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable immediately.  
3.18.2.4 Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the country or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.  
3.18.2.5 For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back value if:

- the National Value is not available, or  
- a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set with which the National Value was received and stored.

3.18.2.6 Note: even though the National Values are always transmitted as a single set for a given system version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a balise group, the on-board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of National Values  
3.18.2.7 The National Values currently applicable when the on-board equipment is switched off (i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain applicable when powered on.  
3.18.2.7.1 Justification: The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been received on-board, there is no need to re-load the information unless National Values change, the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train enters an area requiring different National Values.  
3.18.2.8 The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values.  
3.18.2.8.1 When a new set of National Values becomes applicable its content shall always overwrite the corresponding National Values currently applicable regardless of the country or region identifier(s).  
3.18.2.9 A previously received set of National Values which is not yet applicable shall be deleted if:

- a new set of National Values is received, or  
- the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power mode).

3.18.2.10 If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

of the applicable set with which the National Value was received and stored, then it shall be deleted.

3.18.2.11 When a new set of National Values becomes applicable, any ongoing supervision involving an overwritten National Value of type time or distance shall continue, but using the corresponding value from the new set. However, the starting location or starting time shall remain unchanged.

# 3.18.3 Train Data

3.18.3.1 Train Data can neither be provided nor modified by ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment.  
3.18.3.2 Before starting a mission, the Train Data shall be acquired by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a leading engine

b) Train length

c) Traction / brake parameters:

- Traction model  
- Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake percentage  
- Brake position  
- On-board correction factors

d) Maximum train speed  
e) Loading gauge  
f) Axle load category  
g) Traction system(s) accepted by the engine  
h) Train fitted with airtight system  
i) List of National Systems available on-board  
j) Intentionally deleted

3.18.3.2.1 The Train Data may come from ERTMS/ETCS external sources (e.g. the Train Interface), from pre-configured values or from the driver.  
3.18.3.2.2 Exception: The driver shall never be involved in the entry/ modification/validation of the Train Data "Traction system(s) accepted by the engine", "List of National Systems available on-board" and "Axle number".

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.18.3.2.3 The unit, range and resolution of the Train Data that can be directly entered by the driver shall be as specified in A.3.11.  
3.18.3.3 At standstill, it shall be possible for the driver to enter, modify and revalidate the Train Data that requires driver validation according to the specific train implementation.  
3.18.3.3.1 In normal operation after the start of mission, if a train movement is detected while the driver is modifying or revalidating the Train Data, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger the brake command.  
3.18.3.4 Following any entry/modification of Train Data when a communication session is already established or following the successful establishment of a communication session when valid Train Data are already available (e.g. when approaching a level 2/3 area or an accepting RBC area), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the leading engine shall send the following set of Train Data to the RBC:

a) Train category(ies).  
b) Train length.  
c) Maximum train speed.  
d) Loading gauge.  
e) Axle load category.  
f) Traction system(s) accepted by the engine.  
g) Train fitted with airtight system.  
h) List of National Systems available on-board

i) Axle number

3.18.3.4.1 The RBC shall acknowledge the reception of this set of Train Data.  
3.18.3.4.2 In case the safe radio connection is lost before the acknowledgement is received, the Train Data shall be sent again once the safe radio connection has been re-established within the ongoing communication session.

3.18.4.4.2 All on-board equipments in service, balise groups marked as linked, RBC's, RIU's, and loops shall be assigned a unique ETCS identity within their respective group.  
3.18.4.4.3 The assignment of (unique or not) ETCS identities to balise groups marked as unlinked is the sole responsibility of the entity in charge of the assignment of values (see SUBSET-054), depending on the specific trackside implementation.

# 3.18.4.5 Train Running Number

3.18.4.5.1 During the Start of Mission, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a leading engine shall acquire the train running number from driver input, from the RBC or from other ERTMS/ETCS external sources.  
3.18.4.5.2 It shall be possible to enter train running number also in a non-leading engine.  
3.18.4.5.3 It shall be possible to change the train running number while running, from driver input, from the RBC or from other ERTMS/ETCS external sources.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

3.18.4.5.4 Following any entry/modification of the train running number when a communication session is already established or following the successful establishment of a communication session when valid train running number is already available, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall send the train running number to the RBC.  
3.18.4.5.4.1 Exception: if the train running number has been received from the RBC, it shall not be sent back to the RBC by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.  
3.18.4.5.5 The unit, range and resolution of the train running number shall be as specified in A.3.11.

# A.3.3 Handling of information received from trackside

A.3.3.1 Before it can be accepted and used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, raw information received from trackside is subject to various checks, which can lead to the individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the train orientation), the ignoring of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole message. The SRS clauses/sections corresponding to these checks are gathered in Table 17.

Table 17: Check of raw data received from trackside

A.3.3.2 With the exception of the clauses/sections referred to in Table 17 and of the clause 3.16.3.5.1, all the clauses in this specification in which trackside information is referred to (through the terms "balise", " telegram", " balise group [message]", "message", "[name of] information"...), shall be applied assuming that the information has not been ignored/rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment due to all the checks listed in Table 17.  
A.3.3.3 Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: "If a <consistent> message <composed with telegrams that have passed the system version check, that have not been ignored because of a VBC, that have not been ignored because of duplication, and that have been received while no reverse movement was performed> has been received <with one of its telegrams composing it> containing the information "default balise information" <which is valid for the train orientation (or the balise group crossing direction for NL or SL engines) and which has passed the level and mode filters>, the driver shall be informed."  
A.3.3.4 Example 2: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment will not apply requirements in relation to the content of the telegram or the message such as:

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

- clause 3.6.2.2.2 a), in case the balise group message is rejected because not consistent (e.g. according to 3.16.2.4.1), it does not become LRBG  
- clause 3.16.3.3.3.1, in case the radio message is rejected because of its time stamp, this latter will not be used by the on-board to check the supervision of sequence of further messages  
- clause 3.17.2.3, in case the balise telegram is ignored because of its system version number (e.g. according to 3.17.3.5 d)), this latter will not affect the system version operated by the on-board  
- clause 3.18.2.5  $2^{\text{nd}}$  bullet, in case a message from a balise group marked as linked is rejected because the balise group was not announced by linking (see 3.16.2.4.3), the balise group country or region identifier will not be compared with the one(s) of the currently applicable set of National Values

# A.3.4 Handling of Accepted and Stored Information in specific Situations

# A.3.4.1 Introduction

A.3.4.1.1 All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special situations.  
A.3.4.1.2 The situations acting on the "status" of stored information are:

a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2);  
b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4);  
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2);  
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time-out (3.8.4.4.2);  
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2);  
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);  
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.5.2);  
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2);  
i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b);  
j) the train category, axle load category, loading gauge or traction system is changed and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7);  
k) driver closes the desk during SoM;  
I) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.7)

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

m) inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and no linking is used onboard and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.4.4.2)  
n) the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the on-board considers an SvL (3.8.4.3.2)

# A.3.4.1.3 Depending on the situation, the action shall be one of the following:

a) data is deleted,  
b) data is reset (set to initial states)  
c) data status is unchanged,  
d) data is to be revalidated

# A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations

A.3.5.1 Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside, the on-board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse movement (initiated by driver or due to roll-away) and the sub-sequent forward movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG. This rule shall apply to the following actions:

- Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)  
- Request to acknowledge new level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)  
- Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)  
- Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode transition due to mode profile (see 3.12.4)  
- Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3)  
- Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)  
- Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big metal masses and non stopping areas  
- Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4)  
- Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)  
- Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)  
- Substitute the supervision of the LX start location as the EOA/SvL by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP (see 5.16.2 and 5.16.3)

A.3.5.2 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has received a balise group message (i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s) resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed.  
A.3.5.2.1 Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on-board as happening before the min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.7 applies).  
A.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA/LOA location by the min safe antenna, before a "Stop if in SR" information (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

lead to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to "Stop if in SR". In other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA/LOA and the end of override procedure (see 5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on-board as simultaneously happening before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location.

# A.3.6 Deletion of accepted and stored information when used

# A.3.6.1 Standard case

A.3.6.1.1 When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied by trackside information no longer used, i.e., the related on-board functionality has been completed, shall be made available immediately.

A.3.6.1.1.1 Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity available on-board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information stored on-board given in Subset 040.

# A.3.6.2 Exception

A.3.6.2.1 Following information shall remain stored on-board for a distance defined by a fixed value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:

- location dependent static speed restrictions, i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR (see 3.11.2.2)  
gradient information,  
- reduced adhesion information received from trackside,  
- Track condition "Big metal masses".

A.3.6.2.1.1 Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:

- With the exception of the track condition "Big metal masses", the stored information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to calculate speed supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver)  
- Track condition "Big metal masses" is needed also for a reverse movement itself to avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track.

A.3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is determined by a National/Default value. This is also true for a reverse movement in Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately. In order to keep the on-board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chosen to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is made available again.

# A.3.7 Calculation of the basic deceleration

A.3.7.1 The brake percentage  $(\lambda)$  shall be converted into two different input parameters:  $\lambda_{0} = \lambda$  for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))  $\lambda_{0} = \mathrm{MIN}$ $(\lambda, 135)$  for calculation of service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) where  $\lambda$  is the brake percentage defined as part of Train Data.  
A.3.7.2 The calculation of the basic deceleration (A/basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm that will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake.  
A.3.7.3 The speed limit for the first step shall be calculated as  $V\_lim = x * \lambda_{0}y$ .  
V\_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h  
x = 16.85  
y = 0.428  
A.3.7.4 The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as  $\mathrm{AD\_0} = \mathrm{A}^* \lambda_0 + \mathrm{B}$  AD_0 is the basic deceleration in  $\mathrm{m/s^2}$  for  $0 \leq \text{speed} \leq \mathrm{V\_lim}$ . A = 0.0075 B = 0.076  
A.3.7.5 The following steps of the basic deceleration shall be calculated by means of a set of polynomials of the third order with the following format: AD_n = a3_n *  $\lambda_0^3 + a2_n \cdot \lambda_0^2 + a1_n \cdot \lambda_0 + a0_n$  and with the following values for n (all speed limits in km/h):

$$

A.3.8.4 The equivalent brake build up time for the emergency brake shall be computed as follows:

T_brake_emergency_cm0 = T_brake基礎 eb when V_target = 0

T_brakeemergency_cmt = kto * T_brake/basic eb when V_target > 0

where

V_target is the target speed

A.3.8.5 The correction factor kto shall depend on the brake position as follows:

$$
\mathrm {k t o} = 1 + \mathrm {C t}
$$

where

$\mathrm{Ct} = 0.16$  for freight trains in G

$\mathrm{Ct} = 0.20$  for freight trains in P

$\mathrm{Ct} = 0.20$  for passenger trains

# A.3.9 Calculation of the full service brake equivalent time

A.3.9.1 The basic brake build up time for full service brake for passenger trains in P shall be calculated as:

T_brake_base_sb = a + b * (L/100) + c * (L/100)^2

where

A.3.9.3 The basic brake build up time for full service brake for freight trains in G shall be calculated as:

T_brake_service_cmt = kto * T_brake基礎_sb when V_target > 0

A.3.9.5 The correction factor kto shall be defined as in A.3.8.5  
A.3.9.6 The values of a, b, c and kto used in A.3.9.1, A.3.9.2, A.3.9.3 and A.3.9.4 define reference values for the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake, which shall be considered as maximum ones. If justified by the specific brake system of the train other values of these coefficients, which lead to shorter values of the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake, may be used.  
A.3.9.7 Note: Although certain trains may perform better, the reference values for the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake, as defined here, are the appropriate basis for infrastructure planning.

# A.3.10 Service brake feedback

A.3.10.1 The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves.  
A.3.10.2 The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if:

a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND  
b) The national value does not inhibit its use.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

A.3.10.3 Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe pressure and brake cylinder pressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way:

$\mathsf{p} =$  fictive main brake pipe pressure (kPa)

p_cylinder = brake_cylinder pressure (kPa)

k1 = vehicle dependent constant (set by engineering of ETCS on-board; k1 is normally between 2.0 and 2.7)

p = 500 - p_cylinder / k1

A.3.10.4 The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algorithm to take the service brake feedback into account:

$\mathsf{p} =$  current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in A.3.10.3)

$p0 =$  reference pressure when not braking

p1 = pressure at which the train starts to brake = p0 - 30

p2 = pressure limit, under which T_bs1 and T_bs2 are locked = p0 - 60

p3 = pressure at full service brake = p0 - 150

Q_feedback.active = a Boolean stating whether the feedback function is active, i.e. once it has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the ceiling speed monitoring is entered.

Q_Tbslocked = a boolean stating whether T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to the following values due to enough main brake pipe pressure reduction:

T_bs1_locked = 0 s.

T_bs2_locked = 2s.

Q_displaylocked_P = a boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed is locked due to SB feedback.

Q_displaylocked_SBI = a boolean stating whether the displayed SBI speed (if any) is locked due to SB feedback.

Q_displaylocked_TD = a boolean stating whether the displayed target distance is locked due to SB feedback.

A displayed value is locked from the moment the SB feedback has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the calculated value becomes less than the displayed and locked value. Note: It is only SB feedback that can start the locking of the displayed values. Once started and still locked it remains locked also in case the calculated values are increased due to other reasons (e.g. due to relocation), which will prolong the locking period.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

The reference pressure p0 (nominal value 500 kPa) shall be set on starting the ETCS:

a) To the first stable p value between 400-550 kPa achieved.  
b) Stable in this instance means that the pressure has not varied more than  $\pm 20\mathrm{kPa}$  over 3 seconds.

The reference pressure  $p0$  shall thereafter be adapted to the current pressure according to the following table (which applies if the calculation is performed once per second):

<table><tr><td></td><td>CONDITIONS:</td><td>ACTION:</td><td>REMARKS</td></tr><tr><td>a)</td><td>p = p0</td><td>No change</td><td>Constant pressure</td></tr><tr><td>b)</td><td>p &gt; p0</td><td>p0 = p0 + 1,5</td><td>Increasing pressure</td></tr><tr><td>c)</td><td>p &lt; p0 - 30</td><td>No change</td><td>Braking</td></tr><tr><td>d)</td><td>p0 &gt; p ≥ p0 - 30</td><td>p0 = p0 - 0,5</td><td>Decreasing pressure</td></tr></table>

# Where:

- p is limited to max 550 kPa.  
- Values given in kPa.

A.3.10.5 Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to 0s and 2 s on approaching a non zero target, the locking will remain even if the train speed comes below the target speed. This avoids "jumping" indications related to the values of T_bs1 and T_bs2. It also makes it possible to release the brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To keep 2 s between the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid emergency brake.

A.3.10.6 Note: If feedback is active but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback function will remain active until the ceiling speed monitoring is entered. This avoids "jumping" indications in some rare situations.

a) a ceiling speed: the shunting mode speed limit  
b) a list of expected balise groups (if such list was sent by the trackside equipment). The train shall be tripped if a balise group, not contained in the list, is passed (When an empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise groups can be passed)  
c) "stop if in shunting mode" information. The train is tripped if such information is received from balise groups  
d) Intentionally deleted

4.4.8.1.2 The Shunting mode shall not require Train Data.  
4.4.8.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function  
4.4.8.1.4 Intentionally deleted.

However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order shall be stored and evaluated only when another mode than Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the Shunting movement is terminated).  
4.4.8.1.5.1 When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board in Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store the RBC ID/phone number.  
4.4.8.1.5.2 When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-RBC hand-over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number given at the RBC/RBC border.  
4.4.8.1.6 Shunting mode can be selected by the driver, only accepted when the train is at standstill, or ordered by the trackside.  
4.4.8.1.7 In case of selection of Shunting mode by the driver:

- in level 1 operations, the switch to shunting is always accepted by the on-board equipment  
- in level 2 and 3 areas, the on-board asks the trackside for an authorisation. The switch to shunting is possible only after receiving such authorisation. The trackside can send a list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass while in SH, together with the authorisation

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

4.4.8.1.8 In case of order to switch to Shunting mode from trackside, the order:

- in level 1 is given by a balise group. A list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass after the entry in Shunting, can be sent together with the order  
- in level 2 and 3 is sent via radio. A list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass after the entry in Shunting, can be sent together with the order

4.4.8.1.9 When the switch to shunting is ordered by trackside, a driver acknowledgement is requested.

4.4.8.1.9.1 Note: in Shunting mode the train is only partially supervised, therefore it is necessary that the driver takes the responsibility.  
4.4.8.1.10 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed and, only on driver request, the permitted speed. The display of the permitted speed shall also be stopped on driver request.  
4.4.8.1.11 Intentionally deleted.  
4.4.8.1.12 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 "Modes and on-board functions".

# 4.4.11.1 Description

4.4.11.1.1 The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area.  
4.4.11.1.2 This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example:

a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment starts-up (awakening of the train).  
b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA.  
c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact).

4.4.11.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:

a) a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit  
b) a given distance (regarding its origin location see 4.4.11.1.3.1). The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves with a target speed of zero to the end of this distance. If the train overpasses this distance (see next note) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trip the train  
c) a list of expected balise groups, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train shall be tripped if over-passing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise groups can be passed)  
d) balise groups giving the order 'stop if in SR'. This order shall immediately trip the train, unless the over-passed balise group is included in a list of expected balises as defined in item c)  
e) running in the direction opposite to the train orientation (reverse movement protection)

4.4.11.1.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall determine the start location of the SR distance as follows:

a) If the National/Default value determines the max permitted distance to run in SR mode, the starting point of this distance shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when SR mode was entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode, when Override was activated.  
b) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the start location of the distance shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when the distance information is received or entered.  
c) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted by EUROLOOP, the distance information transmitted by EUROLOOP shall be referred to one or more reference balise groups. On-board shall evaluate

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

the distance to run in SR mode by matching the reference balise groups given with the LRBG.

In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information, the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and the LRBG.

4.4.11.1.4 Note: Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff Responsible mode does not ensure that the train will not pass the given distance.  
4.4.11.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible only at standstill.  
4.4.11.1.5.1 If a train movement is detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance limits, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger the brake command.  
4.4.11.1.5.2 The unit, range and resolution of the SR mode speed limit and distance entered by the driver shall be as specified in A.3.11.  
4.4.11.1.6 If the level is 2/3 and a communication session is open, the driver shall have the possibility to request a new distance to run in Staff Responsible, by selecting "Start". This triggers an MA request.  
4.4.11.1.6.1 Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further.  
4.4.11.1.6.2 When entering SR mode, the value applicable for SR mode speed limit and the value applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default values. Exception for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance.  
4.4.11.1.6.3 While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if available, the last value entered by the driver.  
4.4.11.1.6.4 While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available, the last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment amongst:

a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver;  
b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside.

4.4.11.1.6.5 When "Override" is selected, the SR mode speed limit value and the SR distance value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The corresponding National/Default values shall enter in force.  
4.4.11.1.6.6 If the train is in SR and receives a new distance to run in SR mode from the RBC, the stored list of expected balise groups, if any, shall be deleted or shall be replaced by the list of expected balise groups sent together with the distance to run in SR.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

4.4.11.1.6.7 If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in SR mode, after having received from EUROLOOP max permitted distance to run in SR mode information, detects the main signal balise group being part of this information then it shall ignore any new max permitted distance to run in SR mode information from that loop.  
4.4.11.1.7 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed and the (when active) override (permission to pass a signal at danger, trip inhibited). The permitted speed, target distance and the target speed shall be displayed only on driver request, until the driver requests to stop their display.  
4.4.11.1.8 Intentionally deleted.  
4.4.11.1.9 If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment requests the driver to enter the "track ahead free" information.

4.4.11.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment supervises a ceiling speed, a SR distance if finite and, if available, a list of balises.  
4.4.11.3.2 The driver must check if the track is free, if points are correctly positioned, and must respect the existing line-side information (signals, speed boards etc.).  
4.4.11.3.3 When using the possibility to modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance, the driver is responsible for entering reasonable values.

# 4.4.12 ON SIGHT

# 4.4.12.1 Description

4.4.12.1.1 The On Sight mode enables the train to enter into a track section that could be already occupied by another train, or obstructed by any kind of obstacle.  
4.4.12.1.2 On Sight mode cannot be selected by the driver, but shall be entered automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled.  
4.4.12.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against a dynamic speed profile.  
4.4.12.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed to the driver. The permitted speed, target distance, target speed and release speed (if any) shall be displayed only on driver request, until the driver requests to stop their display (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4.7 "DMI depending on modes").  
4.4.12.1.5 If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment requests the driver to enter the "track ahead free" information.  
4.4.12.1.6 To be in On Sight mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole length of the train, but must be available at least from the FRONT END of the train.  
4.4.12.1.7 Once in On Sight mode, if SSP and gradient are not known for the whole length of the train, an indication "ENTRY IN ON SIGHT" shall be clearly displayed to the driver until SSP and gradient are known for the whole length of the train.

# 4.4.13 TRIP

# 4.4.13.1 Description

# 4.4.13.1.1 Deleted

4.4.13.1.1.1 Note: Application of emergency brakes and train trip are two different things. For example, exceeding the permitted speed leads to application of the emergency brakes, but as long as the train does not pass the EOA/LOA, it is not a train trip.  
4.4.13.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency brakes (no brake release is possible in Trip mode).  
4.4.13.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall indicate to the driver the reason of the train trip.  
4.4.13.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall request an acknowledgement from the driver once train is at standstill (to allow the driver to acknowledge the train trip).  
4.4.13.1.4.1 Note: This acknowledgement is mandatory to exit from Trip mode.  
4.4.13.1.5 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 "Modes and on-board functions".  
4.4.13.1.6 Closing the desk while being in Trip mode will not cause a mode change but no interaction with the driver shall be possible as long as the desk is closed, except isolation of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment

# 4.4.14 POST TRIP

# 4.4.14.1 Description

# 4.4.14.2 Used in levels

4.4.14.1.1 The Post Trip mode shall be entered immediately after the driver acknowledges the trip.  
4.4.14.1.2 Once in post trip mode, the onboard equipment shall release the Command of the emergency brake.  
4.4.14.1.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall keep on indicating to the driver the reason of the train trip.  
4.4.14.1.3 The train shall only be authorised to move backwards a given distance (national value). The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise this national distance for reverse movements, and shall command the service brakes if the distance is over-passed. The driver shall be informed about the reason for the brake application.  
4.4.14.1.3.1 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement Protection (as in PT mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in PT mode). This implies that the given distance to run backwards in PT is considered as a directional data, oriented backwards.  
4.4.14.1.3.2 After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed distance allowed for moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the service brake for any further movement in the direction opposite to the train orientation.  
4.4.14.1.4 When moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the train trip shall be inhibited.  
4.4.14.1.5 Intentionally deleted.  
4.4.14.1.6 When ERTMS/ETCS level is 1, if the driver selects "Start" the onboard equipment proposes Staff Responsible. When ERTMS/ETCS level is 2 or 3, the selection of Start leads to an MA Request to the RBC. It is the RBC responsibility to give an SR authorisation, or a Full Supervision MA or an On Sight/Shunting MA to an ERTMS/ETCS equipment that is in Post Trip mode.

4.4.14.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is responsible for supervising that the train moves only backwards and that the backward movement does not exceed the maximum permitted distance (national value).  
4.4.14.3.2 The driver is responsible if moving the train backwards.

# 4.4.15 NON LEADING

# 4.4.15.1 Description

4.4.15.1.1 The Non-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not remote controlled) but has its own driver.  
4.4.15.1.1.1 Note: This operating situation is called Tandem.  
4.4.15.1.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to enter in Non-Leading mode, a "non leading input signal" from the train interface.  
4.4.15.1.1.3 If the "non leading input signal" is no longer present, the switch to Stand-By mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill.  
4.4.15.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision in Non-Leading mode.  
4.4.15.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to train front/rear end.  
4.4.15.1.4 When level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position to the RBC, according to the previously received parameters.  
4.4.15.1.5 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a non-leading engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which should be handled when the engine leaves Non Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should also try to send an error information to the RBC.  
4.4.15.1.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed to the driver.  
4.4.15.1.7 Intentionally deleted  
4.4.15.1.8 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 "Modes and on-board functions".  
4.4.15.1.9 The supervision of linking consistency shall not be performed in Non Leading mode.  
4.4.15.1.10 In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

4.4.17.5.1 The responsibility of the driver depends on the National System in use.

# 4.4.18 REVERSING

# 4.4.18.1 Description

4.4.18.1.1 The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This is possible only in areas so marked by trackside.  
4.4.18.1.2 Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to reach as fast as possible a "safer" location.  
4.4.18.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:

a) a ceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside  
b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation, given from trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance

4.4.18.1.4 After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing distance, and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the direction opposite to the train orientation.  
4.4.18.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted speed and the remaining distance to run.  
4.4.18.1.6 In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3 table 5, triggering condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency brake instead of the service brake. For the revocation of the brake command, refer to 3.13.10.2.4.  
4.4.18.1.7 The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the driving cab (as before reversing).  
4.4.18.1.8 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement Protection (as in RV mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a directional data, oriented backwards.  
4.4.18.1.9 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 "Modes and on-board functions".  
4.4.18.1.10 In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.  
4.4.18.1.11 In case there is an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall ignore this alarm.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

4.4.18.1.12 In case the ERTMS/ETCS system version number X transmitted by any balise is greater than the highest version X supported by the onboard equipment (refer to 3.17.3.5), the information from this balise shall be ignored, the train shall not be tripped and the driver shall not be informed.

# 4.4.19 LIMITED SUPERVISION

# 4.4.19.1 Description

4.4.19.1.1 The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas where trackside information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train.  
4.4.19.1.2 Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled.  
4.4.19.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against a dynamic speed profile.  
4.4.19.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed and the release speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4.7 "DMI depending on modes"). Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the generic LS function marker is stored on-board or if the conditions in clause 4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also display the lowest speed amongst:

a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the EOA/LOA, AND  
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA

4.4.19.1.4.1 The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised Speed within the Movement Authority (LSSMA)  
4.4.19.1.4.2 Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start a delay timer:

a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the order.  
b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise group giving the order.  
c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer (see section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed.

4.4.19.1.4.3 When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the LSSMA.  
4.4.19.1.4.4 On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the LSSMA display, a toggle on order which has not been executed yet (because the on-board delay timer has not reached the delay time-out value) shall be deleted by the on-board equipment.  
4.4.19.1.4.5 If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall toggle off the LSSMA display in case:

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

a) the clause 4.4.19.1.4.3 is not immediately fulfilled upon reception of a new order to toggle on the LSSMA display  
b) an order to toggle off the LSSMA display is received.

4.4.19.1.4.6 When entering the Limited Supervision mode, the LSSMA display shall be toggled off by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, unless a toggle on order is received and leads immediately to the display of the LSSMA as per clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 and 4.4.19.1.4.3.  
4.4.19.1.4.7 If the generic LS function marker is not stored on-board, the clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6 shall not apply and the LSSMA shall be displayed if:

a) the target speed at the EOA/LOA is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit, AND  
b) the LSSMA is lower than the maximum train speed.

4.4.19.1.4.8 The generic LS function marker shall be deleted by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment as soon as a Limited Supervision mode profile is received without it in the same balise group message.

4.4.19.1.5 If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment requests the driver to enter the "track ahead free" information.  
4.4.19.1.6 To be in Limited Supervision mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole length of the train, but shall be at least available from the FRONT END of the train.  
4.4.19.1.7 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to 4.5 "Modes and on-board functions".

4.4.19.2.1 Used in levels 1, 2 and 3.

# 4.4.19.3 Responsibilities

4.4.19.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is responsible for the background supervision of the train movement to the extent permitted by the information provided by trackside.  
4.4.19.3.1.1 Note: The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas equipped with lineside signals where ETCS does not have information regarding the status of some signals, i.e. not all signals are fitted with LEUs or connected to an RBC  
4.4.19.3.2 The driver must always observe the existing line-side information (signals, speed boards etc.) and National operating rules.  
4.4.19.3.2.1 Note: the indications given to the driver by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment do not substitute the observance of the line-side information. In particular the display of the LSSMA, if deemed necessary by the trackside, only complements

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

the line-side information, e.g. in case there could be a discrepancy between this latter and the background supervision.

# 4.4.20 PASSIVE SHUNTING

# 4.4.20.1 Description

4.4.20.1.1 The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry on a shunting movement with a single engine fitted with one on-board equipment and two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab.  
4.4.20.1.2 The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no information shall be shown).  
4.4.20.1.3 As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision.  
4.4.20.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform Train Position function; in particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to train front/rear end.  
4.4.20.1.5 It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function "Continue Shunting on desk closure".  
4.4.20.1.6 When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Passive Shunting mode if the function "Continue Shunting on desk closure" is active and the "passive shunting input signal" is received from the train interface. If the function "Continue Shunting on desk closure" is not active or the "passive shunting input signal" is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand-By mode instead.  
4.4.20.1.7 The special function "Continue Shunting on desk closure" shall allow one and only one transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be inactive once the Shunting mode is left.  
4.4.20.1.8 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and no "Stop Shunting on desk opening" information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.1.9 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and "Stop Shunting on desk opening" information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode.  
4.4.20.1.10 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which should be handled when the engine leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

4.4.20.1.11 When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage level transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only when another mode than Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the Shunting movement is terminated).  
4.4.20.1.12 When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board in Passive Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store the RBC ID/phone number information.  
4.4.20.1.13 When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-RBC hand-over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number information given at the RBC/RBC border.  
4.4.20.1.14 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 "Modes and on-board functions".  
4.4.20.1.15 In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

# 4.4.20.2 Used in levels

4.4.20.2.1 Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC

# 4.4.20.3 Responsibilities

4.4.20.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of an engine in Passive Shunting mode has no responsibility for the train protection.  
4.4.20.3.2 The notion of responsibility of the driver is not relevant for the Passive Shunting mode.  
4.4.20.3.3 Note: The leading engine is responsible for the movement of the train. It is then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the leading engine that is fully/partially/not responsible for the train protection, with respect to its mode.

# 4.5 Modes and on-board functions

# 4.5.1 Introduction

4.5.1.1 The following table specifies in which modes the on-board functions are active or not. The functions are described in the "Related SRS §" (second column of the table).  
4.5.1.2 Note: Modes are not the only thing that can influence an onboard function. This is why this Table is not enough in itself to understand all the ERTMS/ETCS onboard behaviour. It must be understood as a complement to all other SRS chapters (especially §4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10).  
4.5.1.3 Note: for DMI depending on modes, refer to  $\S 4.7$

# 4.6 Transitions between modes

# 4.6.1 Symbols

4.6.1.1 The indication “ $4>$ ” means: The condition  $n^{\circ}4$  must be fulfilled to trigger the transition  
4.6.1.2 From the mode located in the column  
4.6.1.3 To the mode that is indicated by the arrow  $" > "$  
4.6.1.4 Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “-px-”, x is the priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2.  
4.6.1.5 Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition "from SR to FS" and the transition "from SR to OS" have the same priority order).

# 4.7 DMI depending on modes

# 4.7.1 Introduction

4.7.1.1 The DMI is an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information done via the train interface (e.g. a driver's action on the service brake used for the service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI.  
4.7.1.2 The device(s) used to select "ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered" is (are) not part of the DMI.  
4.7.1.3 The device(s) used to select/indicate "ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not isolated" is (are) part of the DMI.  
4.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted.  
4.7.1.5 Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is not included in the following section.

# 4.7.2 DMI versus Mode Table

4.7.2.1.1  $X =$  active: For a DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the column. For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the column).  
4.7.2.1.2  $A =$  available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here.  
4.7.2.1.3 Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system.  
4.7.2.1.4 NA = Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and outputs cannot be determined.

# 4.8 Acceptance of received information

# 4.8.1 Introduction

4.8.1.1 The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of which information is accepted or rejected depending on the state of the on-board (level, mode) and the nature of the received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill).  
4.8.1.2 The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 "Accepted information depending on the level and transmission media", the third filter in section 4.8.4 "Accepted information depending on the modes".  
4.8.1.3 If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information.  
4.8.1.3.1 Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first considering the on-board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1], [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied, shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level.  
4.8.1.4 Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment - still unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes in which this information is otherwise useless.  
4.8.1.5 If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all other non-infill information in that message.  
4.8.1.6 When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be evaluated prior to any other location related information.

Figure 3: schematic representation of the filtering of received information:

# 4.8.2 Assumptions

4.8.2.1 The following tables shall be applied assuming that:

a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)  
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation, or the balise group crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines).(see section 3.6.3)  
c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the "RBC" information which is marked "A" (Accepted) comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this information is received from the "Accepting" RBC while the "Handing Over" RBC is still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed. Exception 1: The information "Acknowledgement of Train Data", "Trackside constituent system version", "Session Management" and "Acknowledgement of Session Termination" shall be immediately accepted. Exception 2: The information "Co-operative shortening of MA", "Revocation of Emergency Stop" and "LSSMA display toggle on/off order" shall be rejected.  
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG (i.e. relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3).  
e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed (see clause 3.14.3.6)

4.8.2.2 Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be decoded, the information "Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction" is only used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly read, the information "Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction", if received, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need not to be referred to in the following tables.  
4.8.2.3 In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)). Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need not to be referred to in the following tables.  
4.8.2.4 Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), what will happen to the data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an external application, processed by a national function...) is outside the scope of this specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board functionality.

# 4.8.3 Accepted information depending on the level and transmission media

# 4.8.3.1 From RBC or not

4.8.3.1.1 Note: "No" in column "From RBC" has to be understood as any information (type: infill or non-infill) received from a balise group, loop or RIU; this does not include information received from the STM interface.

# 4.8.5 Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or RBC/RBC handover

4.8.5.1 If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3 at a further location has been received, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages.  
4.8.5.2 If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.  
4.8.5.2.1 Note: the term "set of information" refers to the part of a message being stored in the transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immediately) according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or according to 4.8.2.1c (for RBC/RBC handover).  
4.8.5.3 In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored.  
4.8.5.4 The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:

a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition order for a different level, OR  
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to another Accepting RBC, OR  
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored information is terminated

4.8.5.5 At the same time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received.  
4.8.5.6 This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to any use by the on-board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the following principles:

a) Starting from the information currently used by on-board at the moment the level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted.  
b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information, the same rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted outside a level/RBC transition context.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

c) The information resulting from this sequential update shall then be used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

4.8.5.7 Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be accepted or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given stop location. This decision, based on the comparison between the min safe front end position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location, shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).  
4.8.5.7.1 Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see clause 3.10.2.3) when re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.  
4.8.5.8 Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted (Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time when the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed. Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

# 4.9 What happens to accepted and stored information when entering a given level

# 4.9.1 Introduction

4.9.1.1 Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a level transition.  
4.9.1.2 A level transition acts on the "status" of stored information.  
4.9.1.3 In case of entering level 1, MA Request Parameters, Position Report Parameters and Track Ahead Free Request shall be deleted.  
4.9.1.3.1 In case of entering level 0, NTC or 1, the information "Inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises in L2/3" shall be deleted.  
4.9.1.4 For all other stored data, a level transition has no effect (void).

# 4.10 What happens to accepted and stored information when entering a given mode

# 4.10.1 Introduction

4.10.1.1 Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a mode transition.  
4.10.1.2 A mode transition acts on the "status" of stored information.  
4.10.1.3 Depending on which mode is entered, the action shall be one of the following:

a) data is deleted,

b) data is to be revalidated,

c) data is reset (set to default values)

d) data status is unchanged,

# 5.3 Introduction

# 5.3.1 Scope and Purpose

5.3.1.1 This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.  
5.3.1.2 Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and, where convenient, is illustrated by a flowchart.  
5.3.1.3 In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures.  
5.3.1.3.1 Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e.g. cut off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).  
5.3.1.4 National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is retained.

# 5.3.2 Definitions

# 5.3.2.1 Procedures

A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.

# 5.3.2.2 Entities

The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.

# 5.3.2.3 States

States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not completely satisfied.

Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.

Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force branching in states.

# 5.3.2.4 Transitions

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time. When a transition refers to a driver's selection, it means that the conditions to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

# 5.4 Procedure Start of mission

# 5.4.1 Introduction

5.4.1.1 The driver may have to start a mission:

a) Once the train is awake, OR  
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR  
c) Once a mission is ended, OR  
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine.

5.4.1.2 The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation.  
5.4.1.3 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board switches to Sleeping mode).  
5.4.2 Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  
5.4.2.1 At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of three states:

a) "valid" (the stored value is known to be correct)  
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong)  
c) "Unknown" (no stored value available)

5.4.2.2 This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3).  
5.4.2.3 Note 1: The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode".  
5.4.2.4 Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table in section 5.4.3.3.

# 5.4.3 Table of requirements for "Start of Mission" procedure

5.4.3.1 The ID numbers in the table are used for the representation of the procedure in form of a flow chart in section 5.4.4.

# 5.4.3.2 Procedure

# 5.4.5 Degraded Situations

5.4.5.1 Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has not been taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10.  
5.4.5.2 The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does not exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while performing the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or when the driver needs to re-enter already captured data).  
5.4.5.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also offer the driver the following possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3:

a) only at S10 and S20 and if the conditions defined in 5.8.2.1 for Stand By are fulfilled, to select "Override". If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to the procedure "Override" and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train position data (new status: "unknown")  
b) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Driver-ID  
c) only at S10 and S20,to re-enter the "Train running number"  
d) only at S20, to re-enter the Train data. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to S12.  
e) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to S2  
f) only at S20, to select "Non Leading". If the driver chooses to do so, then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train position data (new status: "unknown").  
g) only at S20, to select "Shunting". If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to the procedure "Shunting initiated by driver" and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train position data (new status: "unknown"). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process shall go back to S20.  
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available, to select "Start". If the driver chooses to do so:

- if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23.  
- if the level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22.  
- if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24.  
- if the level is 2/3 and a session is open, then the process shall go to S21.  
- if the level is 2/3 and no session is open, then the process shall go to S24.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

i) only at S10 and S20, to set/remove a Virtual Balise Cover.  
j) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Radio data. If the driver chooses to do so:

If the level is 2/3, then the process shall go to S3.  
- If the level is 0/1/NTC, then the driver shall only have the possibility to modify the Radio Network ID.

# 5.4.6 Entry to Mode Considered as a Mission

5.4.6.1 A mission is considered as started as soon as the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment enters FS, LS, SR, OS, NL, UN, or SN mode.  
5.4.6.2 Entry in all other modes, from SB mode, is not considered as a mission.

# 5.5 Procedure End of Mission

# 5.5.1 Introduction

5.5.1.1 End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment when entering specific modes (see below).

# 5.5.2 Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission:

# 5.5.2.1 Stand-By mode

5.5.2.1.1 From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL, SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode is considered as an End of Mission

5.5.2.1.2 Note: While in SN mode (level NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may depend on the National System.

5.5.2.1.3 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode, from PT mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission.

# 5.5.2.2 Intentionally deleted

# 5.5.2.3 Shunting mode

5.5.2.3.1 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS, LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission.

5.5.2.3.2 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission.

5.5.2.3.3 Note: While in SN mode (level NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may depend on the National System.

# 5.5.3 End of Mission Procedure

5.5.3.1 The procedure comprises the following steps

5.5.3.1.1 Step 1 - MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode dependent, see Chapter 4, section "What happens to accepted and stored information when Entering a Mode").

# 5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside

# 5.7.1 General Requirements

5.7.1.1 This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.

5.7.1.2 Note: The shunting area, possibly including a "safety envelope", can be already occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed according to the relevant procedure.

5.7.1.3 The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile, optionally with a list of balises groups, which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in shunting mode.

5.7.1.4 The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires a driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below.

5.7.1.5 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed.

# 5.7.2 Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from Stand By and Post Trip)

5.7.2.1 In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment the order to switch to shunting at the current location.

5.7.2.2 Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode profile received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for which switching to SH mode is requested.

5.7.2.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).

5.7.2.4 If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

# 5.7.3 Shunting is requested for a further location

5.7.3.1 An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC.

5.7.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two conditions are fulfilled:

a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile  
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or value given in the mode profile)

5.7.3.3 Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates).  
5.7.3.4 Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode, the beginning of the shunting area shall be considered as the EOA (instead of the EOA/LOA derived from the MA) and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the mode profile either:

a) as the SvL derived from the MA. In case the MA defines an LOA, the SvL shall be derived as if no LOA had been given.  
OR  
b) as the beginning of the shunting area.

5.7.3.5 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.6 If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.7.3.7 If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

# 5.7.4 Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode

5.7.4.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the driver.  
5.7.4.2 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform transition to Shunting mode.

# 5.8 Procedure Override

# 5.8.1 Introduction

5.8.1.1 In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track circuit, failed point...), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority.  
5.8.1.2 For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority can be required in degraded situations, e.g.

- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable (e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).  
- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the interface between RBCs is unavailable).  
- In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).  
- In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection with the interlocking)  
- In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route cannot be set)  
- In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened due to a time-out).

5.8.1.3 In level 0/NTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not supervise the train movements.  
5.8.1.4 In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Receiving an order from the signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority, the driver must then be able to inhibit this supervision.  
5.8.1.4.1 Note: The driver must not use the "Override" procedure unless authorised by trackside personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures.  
5.8.1.5 If a signal at danger must be passed between announcement and execution of the level transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System (level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalman gives the order to the driver to select "override".  
5.8.1.6 Note: By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the train driving. Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects "override".  
5.8.1.7 In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group: a) transmitting "stop if in SR mode"

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode  
c) transmitting "stop if in SH mode"  
d) not contained in the list of expected balises in SH mode"  
e) Intentionally deleted

5.8.1.8 Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4)

5.8.2 Selection of "Override"  
5.8.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select "Override" only when:

a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the "override" function (national value) AND  
b) The current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only) or SN (National System) AND  
c) Validated Train Data and Train running number are available (except when already in Shunting mode).

5.8.2.2 Intentionally deleted.  
5.8.2.3 The "Override" procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.

5.8.3 Once the "Override" procedure has been triggered  
5.8.3.1 The mode shall change as follows:

a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand-By or Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if the mode is already SR it remains unchanged)  
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged  
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or SN (level NTC area) the mode shall only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes)

5.8.3.1.1 If the mode, when activating Override, is OS, LS or FS, the former EOA/LOA shall be retained. If the mode is SB or PT, the current position of the train front shall be considered as the former EOA/LOA.  
5.8.3.1.2 Note: This former EOA/LOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is no longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the former EOA/LOA.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

5.8.3.1.3 The former EOA/LOA shall be deleted if:

a) the train reads the information "stop if in SR mode" from a balise group OR  
b) SR mode is left.

5.8.3.2 Note 1: In level 2, 3, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that the Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is any)  
5.8.3.3 Note 2: In level 2,3, if the ERTMS/ETCS- onboard equipment is able to report the mode change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR mode (overriding the national value), a list of balises to be passed in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.4 Note 3: In level 2,3, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes all emergency stop orders previously received.  
5.8.3.5 In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)  
5.8.3.6 The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and only in level 0, 1, 2, 3, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed Restriction (see 3.11.10) as long as the Override function is active.  
5.8.3.7 The status "override active" shall be indicated to the driver.  
5.8.3.7.1 Exception 1: In case the Override function has been activated by an STM (see SUBSET-035), the status "override active" shall not be indicated to the driver.  
5.8.3.7.2 Exception 2: In case the Override function has been activated by selection of "Override" while being in level 0, 1, 2 or 3, the status "override active" shall stop to be indicated to the driver on executing a transition to level NTC.  
5.8.3.8 As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from EUROLOOP shall be rejected.  
5.8.3.9 When "Override" is selected and Override is already active, the supervision of the time and distance (see 5.8.4.1 a) and b)) for train trip suppression shall be re-started.

# 5.8.4 End of Override procedure

5.8.4.1 The Override procedure shall end when at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

a) The "max. time for train trip suppression when Override function is triggered" (national value) elapses after Override has been selected, OR  
b) The train has run more than the "distance for train trip suppression when Override function is triggered" (national value) after Override has been selected, OR

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

c) The former EOA/LOA has been passed with the min safe antenna position (calculated by subtracting distance between active EUROBALISE antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end position), OR  
d) The train passes a balise group giving "stop if in SR mode" or "stop if in SH mode" information, OR  
e) The train passes a balise group giving proceed information (i.e., MA with no signalling related speed restriction of value zero)  
f) In level 2,3, an MA is received from the RBC  
g) The train passes a balise group not in the list of expected balises in SR mode or the list of expected balises in SH mode  
h) The train overpasses the SR distance supervised before overriding with its estimated front end  
i) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches to TR, LS, OS or SH mode.

5.8.4.1.1 Note: For modes UN and SN, only end conditions a) and b) are supervised.  
5.8.4.2 Intentionally deleted.  
5.8.4.3 Intentionally deleted.

# 5.9 Procedure On-Sight

# 5.9.1 General Requirements

5.9.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the beginning of the On Sight area.

5.9.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.

# 5.9.2 On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from Stand By and Post Trip)

5.9.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode.  
5.9.2.2 In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode.  
5.9.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver.  
5.9.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another reason(s).  
5.9.2.5 Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the train speed was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, in Limited Supervision mode or in Staff Responsible mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight supervision (see Figure 4).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/2580db17e35b953800de088cd9c8df10fbc48bd0bf9ea9f25abdf29228e2ee5f.jpg)  
Figure 4: Train enters OS area with too high speed

5.9.2.6 Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or Limited Supervision mode by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = OS mode speed limit) at the location of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.  
5.9.2.7 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the OS mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.

# 5.9.3 On Sight is requested for a further location

5.9.3.1 The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached yet. This occurs when:

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is located at a further location.

5.9.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following conditions are fulfilled:

a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.  
b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or value given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not On Sight

5.9.3.3 The conditions 5.9.3.2 a) and b) define the "rectangle of acknowledgement".  
5.9.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train leaves the "rectangle of acknowledgement" (for example: because the train accelerates).

5.9.3.5 Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to OS mode, the beginning of the On Sight area shall be temporarily considered as the EOA (instead of the EOA/LOA derived from the MA) and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the mode profile either:

a) as the SvL derived from the MA. In case the MA defines an LOA, the SvL shall be derived as if no LOA had been given.

OR

b) as the beginning of the On Sight area.

5.9.3.6 When the driver acknowledges the On Sight mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to the On Sight mode.

Figure 5: Transition from FS/LS to OS mode after driver acknowledgement

5.9.3.7 If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the On Sight area according to the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to OS mode and a request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.9.3.8 If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) after the change to OS mode, the service brake command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 5.9.4 On Sight from Unfitted or SN mode

5.9.4.1 The mode profile with regards to an OS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN mode). A transition to On Sight mode can therefore earliest occur at a transition of level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

5.9.4.2 Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.9.2 shall apply.

# 5.9.5 On Sight from Stand By or Post Trip mode

5.9.5.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the driver.

5.9.5.2 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the transition to On Sight mode."

# 5.9.6 Exit of On Sight mode

# 5.9.6.1 General rule

5.9.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode when the min safe front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.

# 5.9.6.2 First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA

5.9.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has the same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA.  
5.9.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On Sight area.  
5.9.6.2.3 Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of the On Sight area. This information

- can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside scope of ERTMS/ETCS), or  
- can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a "track ahead free" request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this information to the RBC.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

5.9.6.2.4 Note: Receiving the "track ahead free" information, the RBC may be able to transmit an MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.9.6.3 Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA/LOA of the current MA  
5.9.6.3.1 In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On Sight area.  
5.9.6.3.2 When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches either to Full Supervision, to Limited Supervision or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).

# 5.10 Level Transitions

# 5.10.1 General requirements

5.10.1.1 Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2, 3 or NTC is supported shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment via balise group or via the RBC.  
5.10.1.2 A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to the border.  
5.10.1.3 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a level transition announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on-board level, it shall immediately inform the driver about the announced level transition.  
5.10.1.3.1 Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on-board equipment may remain unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.  
5.10.1.4 At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level transition order or a conditional level transition order.  
5.10.1.4.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.

Figure 7: Transition from level X area to level Y area

5.10.1.5 If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall still be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the announcement.  
5.10.1.6 The on-board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a new order to switch to a different level or to the same level but at a different location is received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order shall be executed.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

5.10.1.6.1 In Shunting and Passive Shunting modes only one set of Level Transition Information shall be stored at a time. Therefore a set of Level Transition Information received shall replace any Level Transition Information already stored on-board.  
5.10.1.7 As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data (mainly movement authority and track description data) from the transmission media of the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is effective.  
5.10.1.7.1 Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS chapter 4.8.  
5.10.1.7.2 Note: if only track description has been received from the new media without any movement authority, this track description still replaces the one previously received from the current media when the transition is performed.  
5.10.1.8 When the onboard has performed the level transition, further data (mainly movement authority and track description data) received from the transmission media of the level being left shall be rejected.  
5.10.1.8.1 Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS chapter 4.8.  
5.10.1.9 Intentionally deleted.

# 5.10.2 Table of priority of trackside supported levels

5.10.2.1 Any combination of ERTMS/ETCS levels 0, NTC, 1, 2, and 3 on a given area shall be possible.  
5.10.2.2 The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional level transition order at the border shall contain all the supported ERTMS/ETCS levels with a table of priority. Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority.  
5.10.2.2.1 Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels. This means that, for example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS level 0, and is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS level 1 and 2, the track-side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported levels in all level transition orders and conditional level transition orders applying to that area.  
5.10.2.3 The table of priority shall list all the supported levels from the highest priority level to the lowest one.  
5.10.2.3.1 Intentionally deleted.  
5.10.2.4 When receiving the information about all ERTMS/ETCS levels that are supported by trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall select from the table the level with the highest priority, which is available for use by the onboard equipment.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

5.10.2.4.1 The on-board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as "Available for use" as follows:

a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on-board and at least one Mobile Terminal is available on-board, i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or not.  
b) Level NTC: the concerned National System is available on-board (if an STM is used, refer to SUBSET-035 for further details).  
c) Level 0 or 1: always.

5.10.2.4.1.1 Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment checks the availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used) is an implementation issue.  
5.10.2.4.2 Examples: The table of trackside supported levels gives 2, NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1, 0 and NTC X are "Available for use", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board will select NTC X level. If level 1, 0 and NTC Y are "Available for use", it will select level 1. If level 2, 1 and 0 are "Available for use", it will select level 2.  
5.10.2.5 When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore the requirements related to transitions to the other levels.  
5.10.2.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level transition only.  
5.10.2.7 If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, it shall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the lowest priority.  
5.10.2.7.1 Justification: The On-board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations.  
5.10.2.8 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall store the table of priority of trackside supported ERTMS/ETCS levels.

5.10.3.14.2 If the current level is contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition order, the onboard shall not change the level.  
5.10.3.14.3 If the current level is not contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the same way as an immediate level transition order (see section 5.10.2).  
5.10.3.14.4 In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside.  
5.10.3.14.5 Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold movement. The level of a train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the current level operated by the train.

# 5.10.3.15 Transition initiated by driver

5.10.3.15.1 In addition to the level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possible, at standstill, for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2).  
5.10.3.15.2 If the driver changes the level to 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall establish a communication session with the RBC:

a) immediately if at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network and a valid RBC ID/ phone number is available, OR  
b) once the driver has selected the Radio data (by the same means as for Start of Mission), if either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or no valid RBC ID/phone number is available.

5.10.3.15.2.1 Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC contact information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in PT mode.  
5.10.3.15.3 If the driver changes the level from 2 or 3 to any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is established. When receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the communication session to be terminated.  
5.10.3.15.4 In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has reported having changed from level 2/3 to any other and no order to terminate the session is received within a fixed

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

waiting time (see Appendix A.3.1) from the time the position report was sent, it shall repeatedly send a position report with the fixed waiting time after each repetition, until the order to terminate the session is received, or the defined number of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication session.

# 5.10.4 Acknowledgement of the level transition

5.10.4.1 If defined so for the level transition (see table below), the driver shall be requested to acknowledge the transition

a) when the max safe front end of the train has passed a trackside defined location in rear of the level transition border  
b) upon receipt of the order to switch to the new level immediately

5.10.4.1.1 Exception: An ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in NL mode shall not require an acknowledgement from the driver.  
5.10.4.1.2 Exception to 5.10.4.1.a): in SB mode, the driver shall be requested to acknowledge the level transition only when the level changes.  
5.10.4.2 If the driver has not yet acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) after the level transition, a service brake command shall be initiated.  
5.10.4.3 The service brake command shall then be released when the driver acknowledges the level transition.  
5.10.4.4 For the following transitions marked as “YES”, an acknowledgement shall be required:

# 5.11.4 Degraded Situations

5.11.4.1 ERTMS/ETCS level 2 or 3: no acknowledge for PT mode is received from the RBC  
5.11.4.1.1 In case a communication session is established and no reply is received from the RBC within a fixed waiting time (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after reporting the mode change, the report shall be repeated with the fixed waiting time after each repetition.  
5.11.4.1.2 After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the last sending of the mode change report, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the communication session.  
5.11.4.2 Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has not been taken into account for the design of the flowchart. However, should such a fault occur in any step while ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in level 2/3 and in PT mode, the driver shall have the possibility to select "Override" if the conditions defined in 5.8.2.1 are fulfilled and the process shall go to the procedure "Override".

# 5.12 Change of Train Orientation

# 5.12.1 Introduction

5.12.1.1 The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD position.  
5.12.1.2 This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to change the driving cab.  
5.12.1.3 The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE.  
5.12.1.4 The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post Trip or in Reversing mode.

# 5.12.2 The driver uses the same engine (a mission is ongoing)

5.12.2.1 The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.2.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.  
5.12.2.3 When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment immediately goes to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see "End of Mission" procedure).  
5.12.2.4 When the driver opens the desk B, the "Start of Mission" procedure is triggered.  
5.12.2.5 When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.

# 5.12.3 The driver leaves the engine to go to another one

5.12.3.1 The described situation is the following: The train has two engines (engine A and engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave engine. Each engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on-board equipment is in Sleeping mode. Note: The mode is entered when on-board equipment detects the presence of the "remote control" signal.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading engine but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment is in Non leading mode.  
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment is in Passive Shunting mode.

5.12.3.2 Assumption: The train configuration does not change.

a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.  
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, afterwards engine A will be in NL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode.

# 5.12.3.3 Case "Engine B was in SL mode"

5.12.3.3.1 The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission (see "End of Mission" procedure)  
5.12.3.3.2 As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of engine B switches to Stand-By mode.  
5.12.3.3.3 Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of engine B opens a communication session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC.  
5.12.3.3.4 When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure.

# 5.12.3.4 Case "Engine B was in NL mode"

5.12.3.4.1 The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Non Leading mode.  
5.12.3.4.2 Once the non leading input signal is not received any more, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment of engine B will switch to Stand-By mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5, "End of Mission" procedure).  
5.12.3.4.3 Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment enters Stand-By mode, the "Start of Mission" procedure is triggered.

# 5.12.3.5 Case "Engine B was in PS mode"

5.12.3.5.1 The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes the desk of engine A.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 5.12.4 The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is ongoing)

5.12.3.5.2 The driver opens a desk in engine B, and ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.1 The situation is the following: while the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.  
5.12.4.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.  
5.12.4.2.1 Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function "Continue Shunting on desk closure". When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately go to Passive Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.2.2 When the driver opens the desk B, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch back to Shunting mode.  
5.12.4.3 When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.

# 5.13 Train Reversing

5.13.1.1 This procedure is intended to allow the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run away from a danger up to a "safe" location.  
5.13.1.2 The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).  
5.13.1.3 While the train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be informed that reversing is possible  
5.13.1.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver's intention to reverse (e.g. from a direction controller in reverse position), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode.  
5.13.1.5 If the driver acknowledges, the on-board equipment shall switch to RV mode  
5.13.1.6 Once in RV mode, it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted distance to run and a new maximum speed.  
5.13.1.7 Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for the new permitted distance to run.  
5.13.1.8 Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

# 5.14 Joining / Splitting

# 5.14.1 Definitions

5.14.1.1 Definition for splitting: The "train to be split" is the train at standstill, waiting for being split. The "front train after splitting" refers to the front part of the train before splitting, the "new train after splitting", refers to the other part.

5.14.1.2 Definitions for joining: The "train to be joined" is the train at standstill, waiting for being joined. The "joining train" is the train performing the joining operation.

# 5.14.2 Procedure "Splitting"

5.14.2.1 Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed (this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS).

5.14.2.1.1 Note: If splitting requires moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small distance, this can be done even in SB mode

5.14.2.2 Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train before splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process)

5.14.2.3 Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes). For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment opens a communication session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC.

5.14.2.4 Step 2c - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5, "end of mission" procedure).

5.14.2.5 The driver can then start a new mission with this "new train after splitting" (refer to the "Start of Mission" procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility. Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible.

# 5.14.3 Procedure "Joining"

5.14.3.1 Step 1 - The "joining train" must approach the "train to be joined". This can be performed in SR, OS or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the national procedure for joining).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

5.14.3.2 Step 2 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be closed (vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).  
5.14.3.3 Step 3a - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment remains leading and there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process)  
5.14.3.4 Step 3b - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of mission procedure is executed (see "End of Mission" procedure). Transition to SL mode is from SB mode.  
5.14.3.5 Step 3c - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.14.3.6 For further steps after joining refer to procedures "Start of Mission" and "Change of Train Orientation".

# 5.15 RBC/RBC Handover

# 5.15.1 Principles

5.15.1.1 Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment via a balise group or via the RBC.  
5.15.1.2 The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border.  
5.15.1.2.1 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, ERTMS/ETCS trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the new Radio Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio Network's configuration.  
5.15.1.2.2 In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for communication session with "Handing Over" RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the one used for communication session with "Accepting" RBC.  
5.15.1.2.3 Note: In the following sections, Radio Networks are supposed to be overlapped.  
5.15.1.3 At the RBC/RBC border a balise group with an order to execute the handover immediately shall be placed.  
5.15.1.3.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.  
5.15.1.4 If the message from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location according to the announcement information.  
5.15.1.5 The on-board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC transition at a time, therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order.

# 5.15.2 Procedure

# 5.15.2.1 Overview

5.15.2.1.1 In the normal operation, the main functional steps needed for running from one RBC area to another one are the following:

a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the "Handing Over" RBC;  
b) Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & Establishment of the radio communication session with the "Accepting" RBC;  
c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

d) Announcement of the RBC transition  
e) Transfer of train supervision to the "Accepting" RBC;  
f) Termination of the session with "Handing Over" RBC.  
g) Registration to the new Radio Network of first Mobile Terminal (optional)

# 5.15.2.2 Step by step description

# 5.15.2.2.1 Pre-announcement

5.15.2.2.1.1 When the "Handing Over" RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.

5.15.2.2.1.2 The "Handing Over" RBC informs the "Accepting" RBC about the RBC/RBC handover.

# 5.15.2.2.2 Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & Establishment of the radio communication session with "Accepting" RBC

5.15.2.2.2.1 A radio communication session with the Accepting RBC is opened by the on-board equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the "Handing Over" RBC or from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio communication").

5.15.2.2.2.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, the registration to the new radio network of the second Mobile Terminal is completed before the RBC transition order is transmitted to the on-board equipment.

# 5.15.2.2.3 Generation of MAs including the border

5.15.2.2.3.1 The "Handing Over" RBC is responsible for establishing the movement authority based on:

a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the part of route related information up to the border),  
b) Information from the "Accepting RBC" for the part of route related information in advance of the border.

Figure 9: RBC to RBC transition: MA generation.

5.15.2.2.3.2 When it is required to send a movement authority to the train, the "Handing Over" RBC will request from the "Accepting" RBC information needed for extending the MA in advance of the border.

# 5.15.2.2.4 Announcement

5.15.2.2.4.1 When the train reaches the border with its max safe front end, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report both to the "Handing Over" RBC and to the "Accepting" RBC.

5.15.2.2.4.2 The "Handing Over" RBC forwards the announcement information to the "Accepting" RBC.

5.15.2.2.4.2.1 Note: The forwarding of the announcement information is executed because the "Handing Over" RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in a degraded situation or not i.e. whether it can handle one or two communication sessions.

# 5.15.2.2.5 Transfer of train supervision to "Accepting" RBC

5.15.2.2.5.1 As soon as the on-board has sent to the "Accepting" RBC the position report, it considers to be supervised by the "Accepting" RBC i.e. it uses information received from the "Accepting" RBC.  
5.15.2.2.5.2 When the "Accepting" RBC receives a position report from the on-board and detects that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and informs the "Handing Over" RBC.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 5.15.2.2.6 Termination of the session with "Handing Over" RBC

5.15.2.2.6.1 When the min safe rear end of the train passes the location of the border, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report to the "Handing Over" RBC.  
5.15.2.2.6.2 When this position report is received by the "Handing Over" RBC, it sends an order to terminate the session to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

# 5.15.2.2.7 Registration to the new Radio Network of first Mobile Terminal (optional)

5.15.2.2.7.1 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, the registration to the new Radio Network of the first Mobile Terminal is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment as soon as the communication session with the "Handing Over" RBC has been terminated and the safe radio connection has been released.

# 5.15.3 Degraded situation: Only one communication session can be handled

# 5.15.3.1 Overview

5.15.3.1.1 In this case, the main functional steps needed for running from one RBC area to another one are the following:

a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the "Handing Over" RBC;  
b) Generation of movement authorities including the border;  
c) Announcement of the RBC transition  
d) Termination of the session with "Handing Over" RBC;  
e) Registration to the new Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal (optional) & Establishment of the radio communication session with the "Accepting" RBC;  
f) Transfer of train supervision to the "Accepting" RBC.

# 5.15.3.2 Step by step description

# 5.15.3.2.1 Pre-announcement

5.15.3.2.1.1 When the "Handing over" RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.

5.15.3.2.1.2 The "Handing Over" RBC informs the "Accepting" RBC about the RBC/RBC transition.

# 5.15.3.2.2 Generation of MAs including the border

5.15.3.2.2.1 The "Handing Over" RBC is responsible for establishing the movement authority based on (see Figure 9)

a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the part of route related information up to the border),

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

b) Information from the "Accepting RBC" for the part of route related information in advance of the border.

5.15.3.2.2.2 When it is required to send a movement authority to the train, the "Handing Over" RBC will request from the "Accepting RBC" information needed for extending the MA in advance of the border.

# 5.15.3.2.3 Announcement

5.15.3.2.3.1 When the train with its max safe front end reaches the border, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report to the "Handing Over" RBC.

5.15.3.2.3.2 The "Handing Over" RBC forwards the announcement information to the "Accepting" RBC.

# 5.15.3.2.4 Termination of the session with "Handing Over" RBC

5.15.3.2.4.1 As requested by the RBC transition order, when the min safe rear end of the train passes the location of the border, the on-board equipment sends a position report to the "Handing Over" RBC.

5.15.3.2.4.2 When this position report is received by the "Handing Over" RBC, it sends an order to terminate the session to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

# 5.15.3.2.5 Registration to the new Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal (optional) & Establishment of the radio communication session with "Accepting" RBC

5.15.3.2.5.1 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives the session termination order from the "Handing Over" RBC, it terminates the session with the "Handing over" RBC and opens a session with the "Accepting" RBC (refer to chapter 3, management of radio communication).

5.15.3.2.5.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change: as soon as the session with the "Handing Over" RBC is terminated, the registration to the new Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal is enforced by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment prior to the opening of a session with the "Accepting" RBC (refer to chapter 3, management of radio communication).

# 5.15.3.2.6 Transfer of train supervision to "Accepting" RBC

5.15.3.2.6.1 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has established a communication session with the "Accepting" RBC and sent to the "Accepting" RBC a position report, it considers to be supervised by the "Accepting" RBC, i.e. it accepts only information received from the "Accepting" RBC.

5.15.3.2.6.2 When the "Accepting" RBC receives a position report from the on-board and detects that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and informs the "Handing Over" RBC.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 5.15.4 Other degraded Situations

5.15.4.1 Note: If the "Handing Over" RBC is not able to extend the MA into the area of the "Accepting RBC", the driver may select "override", or manually change the level to move the train into the area of the "Accepting RBC".  
5.15.4.2 Note: If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot open a session with the "Accepting RBC", the train is stopped at the latest when it has reached the EOA given by the "Handing Over" RBC. For passing the EOA the driver may select "override", or manually change the level.

# 5.16 Procedure passing a non protected Level Crossing

# 5.16.1 General Requirements

5.16.1.1 In case the LX is not protected, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (in FS, LS or OS mode) shall temporarily supervise the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL (instead of the EOA/LOA and the SvL (if any) derived from the MA), with no release speed.  
5.16.1.2 The supervision of the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL shall be substituted by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP under conditions depending on whether stopping in rear of the LX start location is required or not. The conditions of this substitution are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3.  
5.16.1.3 The start location of the LX speed restriction depends on the substitution conditions, which are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3. The end location of the LX speed restriction shall be the LX end location.  
5.16.1.4 When approaching a non protected LX, the on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the LX, as soon as:

a) either the EOA or the SvL related to the LX start location becomes the Most Relevant Displayed Target (see 3.13.10.4.2), or

b) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment substitutes the supervision of the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP.

5.16.1.5 Indication given to the driver shall remain displayed until one of the following conditions is met:

a) information "LX is protected" is received on-board;  
b) train has passed the LX end location with its min safe front end.

# 5.16.2 Stopping in rear of non protected LX is required

5.16.2.1 Once the train has stopped with its estimated front end inside the stopping area, given by trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall no longer supervise the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL (i.e. the EOA/LOA and the SvL (if any) derived from the MA shall be again supervised) and shall immediately include the LX speed restriction in the MRSP, starting from the estimated train front end.

Figure 10: Approaching a non protected LX with stopping required

# 5.16.3 Stopping in rear of non protected LX is not required

5.16.3.1 In case stopping in rear of the non protected LX is not required, the LX start location shall be supervised as both the EOA and SvL until the train reaches the location of the braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit calculated for the LX speed (see 3.13.9.3.5.11&12 for the calculation of this location).

5.16.3.2 As soon as the estimated or the max safe front end (depending whether the most restrictive SBI supervision limit at LX speed is the SBI1 or the SBI2, see 3.13.9.3.5.11) reaches the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit calculated for the LX speed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall no longer supervise the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL (i.e. the EOA/LOA and the SvL (if any) derived from the MA shall be again supervised) and shall immediately include the LX speed restriction in the MRSP, starting from the train front end (estimated or max safe), which has reached the concerned Permitted speed supervision limit location.

Figure 11: Approaching a non protected LX with stopping not required

5.16.3.3 Note: A braking curve to zero, instead of a braking curve to the LX speed at the LX start location, will ensure that the train is able to stop before the start location of the level crossing, in case this latter is not free for the train to pass. Close to the level crossing it is then the responsibility of the driver to proceed or not with LX speed as a maximum.

# 5.17 Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver

# 5.17.1 Introduction

5.17.1.1 When valid Train Data is stored on-board, input information acquired from ERTMS/ETCS external sources different from the driver may affect some of the Train Data, depending on the type of train (e.g. tilting input information from tilting external device may affect the train category and the loading gauge).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

5.17.1.2 The procedure here below describes the necessary steps performed by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment from the detection of an input information change on an external interface, to the effective encountering of the Train Data change by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

# 5.18.8 Advising a tunnel stopping area

5.18.8.1 This procedure is dealing with the indication to the driver of an area under a tunnel where stopping is permitted, and suitable escaping paths are provided.  
5.18.8.1.1 Note: the tunnel stopping areas are designed in such a way that the passengers can step out, use a walkway along the track and reach the safe area, taking into account the longest admissible train in the tunnel stopped with its front end within the tunnel stopping area.  
5.18.8.2 On driver request, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall enable/disable the display of the tunnel stopping area related information (initial state: disabled).

5.18.8.3 As long as the display of the tunnel stopping areas is enabled (point C) and there are tunnel stopping areas stored on-board, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall continuously check the current speed and position of the train to determine whether the driver can stop the train with the full service brake before reaching the end of the closest tunnel stopping area. This shall be achieved taking into account a virtual Permitted supervision limit (with no contribution of the GUI curve, if any), calculated at the estimated speed from an SBD curve of which the foot is the end location of the tunnel stopping area:

a) If the train front end is in rear of the Permitted supervision limit, the tunnel stopping area related information shall be displayed to the driver.  
b) If the train front end is in advance of the Permitted supervision limit, no information related to this tunnel stopping area shall be displayed and the next tunnel stopping area stored on-board, if any, shall be checked.

5.18.8.4 Before the train reaches the start location (point D) of the tunnel stopping area, the "tunnel stopping area announcement" shall be displayed to the driver. This shall include the indication of the remaining distance to the start location of the tunnel stopping area.  
5.18.8.5 When the train front end reaches the start location (point D) of the tunnel stopping area:

- "Tunnel stopping area announcement" shall no longer be displayed  
- "Tunnel stopping area" information shall be displayed to the driver.

5.18.8.6 Note: the display of the "tunnel stopping area" information will always end before the point E is reached, because of the condition 5.18.8.3 b).

# 5.18.9 Sounding the horn

5.18.9.1 This procedure is dealing with the indication to the driver of a request to sound the horn.  
5.18.9.2 "Sound horn" shall be displayed to the driver when the estimated front end of the train reaches a location (point C) in rear of the beginning of the "sound horn" area (point D).  
5.18.9.2.1 This location (point C) shall be determined by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment taking into account the time necessary for the driver to perform the required action (see Appendix A.3.1) and the current train speed.  
5.18.9.3 When the estimated front end of the train reaches the end location (point E) of the "sound horn" area, the indication "Sound horn" information shall no longer be displayed.  
5.18.9.4 Note: In order not to encourage the driver to stop sounding the horn too early, the track condition "sound horn" is defined as an area so that the display of the indication "Sound horn" continues during a certain distance sent by trackside (i.e. until point E), after the theoretical location of the board on the line (i.e. point D).

# 5.18.10 Changing the traction system

5.18.10.1 This procedure is dealing with the announcement and indication to the driver of a change of traction system.  
5.18.10.2 "Change of traction system announcement" shall be displayed to the driver when the max safe front end of the train reaches a location (point C) in rear of the location of change of traction system (point F).

5.18.10.3 This location (point C) shall be determined by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment taking into account the time necessary for performing the required actions and the current train speed.  
5.18.10.4 The displayed "Change of traction system announcement" information shall also indicate if the related functionality is executed

automatically, or  
- if the driver is requested to act.

5.18.10.4.1 Note: Whether the operation is automatic or manual is application dependent.  
5.18.10.5 When the max safe front end of the train reaches the "Change of traction system" location (point F):

- the "Change of traction system announcement" information shall no longer be displayed to the driver,  
- the "New traction system" information shall be displayed to the driver.

5.18.10.6 The "New traction system" information shall remain displayed for a fixed time (see Appendix A.3.1) after the minimum safe rear end of the train has passed the "Change of traction system" location (point F).  
5.18.10.6.1 Note: The train front end position when this information disappears is shown as point G in the Figure 21.

# 5.19 Procedure Limited Supervision

# 5.19.1 General Requirements

5.19.1.1 The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode profile.  
5.19.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.

# 5.19.2 Limited Supervision is requested for current location (from modes different from Stand By and Post Trip)

5.19.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise (group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.2 In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving a Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver.  
5.19.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another reason(s).  
5.19.2.5 Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited Supervision mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff Responsible mode) then an emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the LS supervision (see Figure 22).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/e4ff3ba2f41a4f2e7e2e6c93bd8c1ada13ef81d934f92f6770adfb325393cd21.jpg)  
Figure 22: Train enters LS area with too high speed

5.19.2.6 Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or On Sight mode by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = LS mode speed limit) at the location of transition to Limited Supervision mode.  
5.19.2.7 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in LS mode when receiving the LS mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.

# 5.19.3 Limited Supervision is requested for a further location

5.19.3.1 The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not reached yet. This occurs when:

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision area that is located at a further location.  
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision area that is located at a further location.

5.19.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following conditions are fulfilled:

a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of Limited Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.  
b) The speed is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national value, or value given in the mode profile).  
c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision

5.19.3.3 Note: The first 2 conditions define the "rectangle of acknowledgement".  
5.19.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train leaves the "rectangle of acknowledgement" (for example: because the train accelerates).

5.19.3.5 Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to LS mode, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area shall be temporarily considered as the EOA (instead of the EOA/LOA derived from the MA) and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the mode profile either:

a) as the SvL derived from the MA. In case the MA defines an LOA, the SvL shall be derived as if no LOA had been given.

OR

b) as the beginning of the Limited Supervision area.

5.19.3.6 When the driver acknowledges the Limited Supervision mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to the Limited Supervision mode.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-11/7a50b195-870d-4d49-bd6c-7a42d9521f78/b52b0db42c96e0322a6cdb7f75518bbded672bfd0201bd27e45cd1037c447a09.jpg)  
Figure 23: Transition to LS mode after driver acknowledgement

5.19.3.7 If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the Limited Supervision area according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to LS mode and a request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  
5.19.3.8 If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) after the change to LS mode, the service brake command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

# 5.19.4 Limited Supervision from Unfitted or SN mode

5.19.4.1 The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN mode). A transition to Limited Supervision mode can therefore earliest occur at a transition of level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

5.19.4.2 Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.19.2 shall apply.

# 5.19.5 Limited Supervision from Stand By or Post Trip mode

5.19.5.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the driver.

5.19.5.2 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the transition to Limited Supervision mode.

# 5.19.6 Exit of Limited Supervision mode

# 5.19.6.1 General rule

5.19.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall exit the Limited Supervision mode when the min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.

# 5.19.6.2 First case: The Limited supervision area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA

5.19.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode Profile has the same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA.

5.19.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the Limited Supervision area.

# 5.19.6.3 Second case: The Limited Supervision area ends before the EOA/LOA of the current MA

5.19.6.3.1 In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Limited Supervision area.

5.19.6.3.2 When exiting the Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).

# 5.20 Generation of Track Conditions related information to an ERTMS/ETCS external function

# 5.20.1 Introduction

5.20.1.1 This set of procedures specifies the information generated by the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment to an ERTMS/ETCS external function in relation to the following track-conditions:

b) powerless section with main power switch to be switched off,  
c) passing an "air tightness" area,  
d) inhibition of a defined type of brake,  
e) change of traction system,  
f) change of allowed current consumption,  
g) station platform.

5.20.1.2 In the following sections, the remaining distance from the concerned train end to the concerned track condition location shall be counted positive when the train end is in rear of the location and shall be counted negative when the train end is in advance of the location.

# 5.20.2 Passing a powerless section with pantograph to be lowered

5.20.2.1 This procedure is dealing with the generation of the information related to a powerless section with the pantograph to be lowered.  
5.20.2.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the generation of the information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function when the max safe front end of the train reaches the point C in rear of the start location of the powerless section (see 5.18.2.2.1 for the definition of point C).

5.20.2.5 When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the end location (point E) of the powerless section, the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to point E shall no longer be generated.  
5.20.2.6 Note: The remaining distance from the train max safe front end to point D and the remaining distance from the train min safe front end to point E are generated until the min safe rear end passes respectively the point D and the point E to allow the ERTMS/ETCS external function to manage each pantograph individually assuming that this function knows the distance between each pantograph and the train front end.

- the position of the station platform (left side, right side, both sides) in reference to the train orientation

5.20.8.5 When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the start location (point D) of the station platform, the remaining distance from the max safe front end of the train to point D shall no longer be generated. The remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to the end location (point E) of the station platform as well as its nominal height above the rail level and its position shall continue to be generated.  
5.20.8.6 When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the end location (point E) of the station platform, the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to point E, the position of the station platform and its nominal height above the rail level shall no longer be generated.  
5.20.8.7 Note: The remaining distance from the train max safe front end to point D and the remaining distance from the train min safe front end to point E are generated until the min safe rear end passes respectively the point D and the point E to allow the

ERTMS/ETCS external function to manage each door individually assuming that this function knows the distance between each door and the train front end.

5.20.8.8 Note: When resuming the initial state (see 3.7.3.2) or any other reason (e.g. see Appendix A.3.4) leads to the shortening of a station platform, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment considers the new end location (point E) of the station platform for the calculation of the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to the point E.  
5.20.8.9 If resuming the initial state (see 3.7.3.2) or any other reason (e.g. see Appendix A.3.4) leads to the deletion of the station platform, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop providing information related to this station platform to the ERTMS/ETCS external function.

# 6.3 Scope

6.3.1.1 The chapter defines the composition of envelope of legally operated system versions, i.e. all the ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate and that on-board equipment shall support.  
6.3.1.2 By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters are applicable regardless of the system version operated (see SUBSET-104 § 6.1.3.2); this chapter includes the exceptions to those clauses and the additional clauses, which apply when the system version of some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a version number older than the last one introduced.

# 6.4 Envelope of legally operated system versions

# 6.4.1 Incompatible versions

6.4.1.1 The system version number X, which a trackside infrastructure is allowed to operate with, shall be one of the following: 1 or 2

# 6.4.2 Compatible versions

6.4.2.1 Within system version number  $X = 1$ , the system version number  $Y$  that a trackside infrastructure is allowed to use shall be any of the following: 0 or 1  
6.4.2.2 Within system version number  $X = 2$ , the system version number  $Y$  that a trackside infrastructure is allowed to use shall be any of the following: 0 or 1

# 6.5 Trackside requirements in relation to older system versions

# 6.5.1 Trackside areas operated with system version number  $X = 1$

# 6.5.1.1 Introduction

6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still operated with the system version number  $X = 1$ , after the entry into force of this release of the SRS.  
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number  $X = 1$ , it shall be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0, and 1.1  
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number  $X = 1$ , it shall also be allowed to use for balises the following values of M_VERSION: 2.0 and 2.1.  
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area support the system version number  $X = 2$  and the on-board requirements related to the trackside information marked with 2.0 or 2.1 are applicable regardless of the operated version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter operates with the system version number  $X = 1$  ordered by RBC).

6.6.3.1.2 For information received from trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use the translation tables defined here below, in order to use the information as if it had been elaborated in compliance with the current chapters 7 and 8.

# 6.6.3.2 Packets received from balise, loop, RIU, RBC

6.6.3.2.1 In the table below, the translation of information may depend on the on-board operated system version at the time the information is received and accepted on-board.  
6.6.3.2.2 When a level transition or an RBC/RBC handover is announced, the information stored on-board in the transition buffer shall be translated according to system version operated on-board at the time the information is released from the transition buffer (i.e. the system version operated by the trackside infrastructure, towards which the train is running).

6.6.3.2.3 Depending on the packet, the action can be:

a) data is unchanged,  
b) data is rejected,  
c) data is translated,  
d) not relevant

# 7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language

# 7.3.1 Introduction

7.3.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise and loop airgaps.  
7.3.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams (variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages are described in chapter 8).  
7.3.1.3 Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, depending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior verification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details.

# 7.3.2 Definition of Variables

7.3.2.1 Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor units. The whole variable has one type (meaning).  
7.3.2.2 Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the variable.  
7.3.2.3 Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.g.  $32767 =$  "unknown").  
7.3.2.4 Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range  
7.3.2.5 Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different names.  
7.3.2.6 All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are used, if used in more than one media.  
7.3.2.7 Signed values shall be encoded as 2's complement.  
7.3.2.8 One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true.  
7.3.2.9 Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where justified.  
7.3.2.10 When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall be transmitted first.  
7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

<table><tr><td>A_</td><td>Acceleration</td></tr><tr><td>D_</td><td>distance</td></tr><tr><td>G_</td><td>Gradient</td></tr><tr><td>L_</td><td>length</td></tr><tr><td>M_</td><td>Miscellaneous</td></tr><tr><td>N_</td><td>Number</td></tr><tr><td>NC_</td><td>class number</td></tr><tr><td>NID_</td><td>identity number</td></tr><tr><td>Q_</td><td>Qualifier</td></tr><tr><td>T_</td><td>time/date</td></tr><tr><td>V_</td><td>Speed</td></tr><tr><td>X_</td><td>Text</td></tr></table>

# 7.3.3 Definition of Packets

7.3.3.1 Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal structure.  
7.3.3.2 This structure consists of a packet header with:

- Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Number</td><td>NIDPACKET</td><td>Packet identifier</td></tr><tr><td>Direction</td><td>Q_DIR</td><td>Specifies the validity direction of transmitted data</td></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td>LPACKET</td><td>Number of bits in the packet</td></tr><tr><td>Scale</td><td>Q_SCALE</td><td>Specifies which distance scale is used for all distance information within the packet. There is no Q_SCALE variable in packets which do not contain distance information.</td></tr><tr><td>Information</td><td>......</td><td>Well defined set(s) of variables.</td></tr></table>

- Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Number</td><td>NID(Packet)</td><td>Packet identifier</td></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td>LPACKET</td><td>Number of bits in the packet</td></tr><tr><td>Scale</td><td>Q_SCALE</td><td>Specifies which distance scale is used for all distance information within the packet.</td></tr></table>

Information

<table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>......</td></tr></table>

There is no Q_SCALE variable in packets which do not contain distance information.

Well defined set(s) of variables.

7.3.3.3 The packet definition does not change when transmitted over different transmission media.  
7.3.3.4 All currently not defined packet identifiers are reserved for future use and shall be considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values) when received by the on-board equipment.

# 8.3 Introduction

# 8.3.1 Scope and Purpose

8.3.1.1 This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS functions.  
8.3.1.2 Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such as medium-specific use constraints (e.g. distance between track-circuit and balise...), as well as functions (e.g. detection of balise reference, time and location stamp, identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio connection...) and performance of the transmission media.

# 8.3.2 Definitions

8.3.2.1 Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission media used for ETCS (Eurocalise, Euroradio and Euroloop).  
8.3.2.2 A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the transmission medium).  
8.3.2.3 A Eurocalse message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group ( telegram from balise number 1 first), each telegram is transmitted by a Eurocalse). A Eurocalse telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of Packets.

8.3.2.4 A Euroradio message contains one header and an identified and coherent set of variables (if needed) and Packets.  
8.3.2.5 A Euroloop message contains one header and an identified and coherent set of Packets.

# 8.4 Rules

# 8.4.1 Common Rules

8.4.1.1 A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurocalise) is composed of

1. One Header,  
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio),  
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio),  
4. Optional Packets as needed by application.

8.4.1.2 The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message format (from top to bottom).  
8.4.1.3 The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given by the message.  
8.4.1.3.1 Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 (Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such packet.  
8.4.1.3.2 Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of balise group (balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of LRBG (radio transmission).  
8.4.1.4 A track-to-train message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type for the same direction.  
8.4.1.4.1 Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).  
8.4.1.4.2 Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed Restriction). In case of revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.3 Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.4 Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is to be considered as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a balise group shall have identical content per direction.

# ERA*UNISIG*EEIGERTMSUSERSGROUP

8.4.1.4.5 Exception 5: A message can contain several packets 88 (Level Crossing information). The identities of the corresponding Level Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.4.6 Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254 (default balise, loop or RIU information).  
8.4.1.4.7 Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 145 (Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction).  
8.4.1.4.8 Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0 (Virtual Balise Cover marker).  
8.4.1.4.9 Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6 (Virtual Balise Cover order). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C) of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different.  
8.4.1.5 A train-to-track message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type.  
8.4.1.5.1 Exception: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).  
8.4.1.6 Note: For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4, when the same packet is transmitted by duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within the message. Justification: The on-board equipment will only use one of these duplicated telegrams (and therefore only one set of duplicated packets) to compose the balise group message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2).

# 8.4.2 Rules for Eurocalise telegrams

8.4.2.1 The format of the telegram to be transmitted by each balise is as follows:

<table><tr><td colspan="4">General Format of Balise Telegram</td></tr><tr><td>Field No.</td><td>VARIABLE</td><td>Length ( bits)</td><td>Remarks</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Q_UPDOWN</td><td>1</td><td>Defines the direction of the information:

applicable for packets.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Packet 255</td><td>8</td><td>Finishing flag of the telegram</td></tr></table>

Number of bits in balise header: 50

8.4.2.2 The user information transmitted by a balise shall contain complete packets, i.e. splitting a packet between two balises is forbidden.  
8.4.2.3 When used, the packet 0 shall be transmitted as the first packet of the telegram (i.e. it is appended to the header).

# 8.4.3 Rules for Euroloop messages

8.4.3.1 The format of the message to be transmitted by each loop is as follows:

General Format of Loop Message  

<table><tr><td>Field No.</td><td>VARIABLE</td><td>Length ( bits)</td><td>Remarks</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Q_UPDOWN</td><td>1</td><td>Defines the direction of the information:

Number of bits in loop header: 33

8.4.3.2 Intentionally deleted.

# 8.4.4 Rules for Euroradio messages

8.4.4.1 The message identifier is unique (variable NID_MESSAGE).  
8.4.4.1.1 All currently not defined message identifiers are reserved for future use and shall be considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values) when received by the on-board equipment. Exception: reception of information only differing by Y with regards to the highest system version number X supported by on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11 b)).  
8.4.4.2 Each message shall indicate its own length through the use of the variable L_MESSAGE.  
8.4.4.2.1 If the computed length of the message is not equal to the length given by LMESSAGE, the entire message shall be rejected.  
8.4.4.3 The messages shall be composed of predefined variables and packets.  
8.4.4.4 For some messages, it shall be possible to add optional packets at the end of the message.  
8.4.4.4.1 The track to train messages possibly including optional packets are listed hereafter:

<table><tr><td>Track to Train message</td><td>Mess.

# 9.3 Introduction

# 9.3.1 Scope and Purpose

9.3.1.1 Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of the SRS.  
9.3.1.2 The purpose of this chapter is to ease the assessment of the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment with the SRS.  
9.3.1.3 To that effect, this chapter comprehensively identifies which clauses contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either because they contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or because they are of another type.

# 9.3.2 Definitions

9.3.2.1 The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause:

a) ERTMS/ETCS on-board requirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS on-board  
b) ERTMS/ETCS trackside requirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS trackside, in case the corresponding function is implemented  
c) Definition: a clause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of requirement(s) or without which requirement(s) cannot be unambiguously interpreted  
d) Informative: a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the justification of requirement(s)  
e) Others: a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories

9.3.2.2 Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword "shall". However:

a) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on the accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMS/ETCS onboard and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword "shall".  
b) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables, see chapters 7 and 8) are also described with tables. The numbered titles (i.e. the name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated table are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS onboard and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword "shall" either.

9.3.2.3 Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined, in case a requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and ERTMS/ETCS trackside or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on-board and trackside requirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability reasons.
