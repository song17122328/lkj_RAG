Abstract: Performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train control (CBTC) system are established in this standard. A CBTC system is a continuous, automatic train control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits; continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and train-borne and wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well as optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions. In addition to CBTC functional requirements, this standard also defines headway criteria, system safety criteria, and system availability criteria for a CBTC system. This standard is applicable to the full range of transit applications including automated people movers.

IEEE Standards documents are developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. The IEEE develops its standards through a consensus development process, approved by the American National Standards Institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to achieve the final product. Volunteers are not necessarily members of the Institute and serve without compensation. While the IEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process, the IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information contained in its standards.

# Introduction

[This introduction is not part of IEEE Std 1474.1-2004, IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements.]

This introduction provides some background on the rationale used to develop this standard. This information is meant to aid in the understanding, usage, and applicability of this standard.

Conventional signaling/train control systems rely almost exclusively on track circuits to detect the presence of trains. Information on the status of the track ahead is provided to train operators either through wayside signals or train-borne cab signals. Ensuring compliance with the signals is achieved through operating procedures, wayside automatic train stops, or train-borne supervisory equipment linked to the train's braking system. These conventional systems are effective in providing train protection, but are not particularly efficient in maximizing the utilization of the rail transit infrastructure, as a result of a number of fundamental limitations, specifically, the following:

a) The location of trains can only be determined to the resolution of the track circuits; if any part of a track circuit is occupied by a train, the whole track circuit must be assumed to be occupied by the train. Track circuits can be made shorter, but each additional track circuit requires additional wayside hardware, so there is an economical and practical limit to the number of track circuits that can be provided.  
b) The information that can be provided to a train is limited to a small number of wayside signal aspects or a small number of speed codes in a cab signal system.  
c) For a wayside signal system with automatic train stops but without continuous cab signaling, enforcement is intermittent.

CBTC systems overcome these fundamental limitations of conventional track circuit-based systems, and therefore, permit more effective utilization of the transit infrastructure. This is accomplished, for example, by allowing trains to operate safely at much closer headways, by permitting greater flexibility and greater precision in train control, and by providing continuous safe train separation assurance and overspeed protection. Additional benefits of CBTC technology include the economical support of automatic train operations (both on the mainline and in maintenance yards), improved reliability, and reductions in maintenance costs through a reduction in wayside equipment and real-time diagnostic information. The basic characteristics of a CBTC system include the following:

1) Determination of train location, to a high degree of precision, independent of track circuits.  
2) A geographically continuous train-to-wayside and wayside-to-train data communications network to permit the transfer of significantly more control and status information than is possible with conventional systems.  
3) Wayside and train-borne vital processors to process the train status and control data and provide continuous automatic train protection (ATP). Automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions can also be provided, as required by the particular application.

Although the benefits of CBTC technology are recognized, there are currently no independent standards defining the performance and functional requirements that need to be satisfied by CBTC systems in order to realize enhanced performance, availability, train operational flexibility, and train protection. This standard has been developed to address this.

# 4. General requirements

# 4.1 Characteristics of CBTC systems

The primary characteristics of a CBTC system include the following:

a) High-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits  
b) Continuous, high capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications  
c) Train-borne and wayside processors performing vital functions

# 4.2 Categorization of CBTC systems

This standard recognizes that different configurations of CBTC systems are possible, depending on the specific application. For example, a CBTC system may

a) Provide ATP functions only, with no ATO or ATS functions.  
b) Provide ATP functions, as well as certain ATO and/or ATS functions, as required to satisfy the operational needs of the specific application.  
c) Be the only train control system in a given application or may be used in conjunction with other auxiliary wayside systems.

A typical functional block diagram for a CBTC system is given in Annex B.

# 4.3 Range of applications

The CBTC performance and functional requirements defined in this standard are intended to be applicable to the full range of transit applications, including light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail transit systems, and shall be applicable to other transit applications, such as automated people movers (APMs) if CBTC is used for ATC.

NOTE—ASCE 21-96 [B3] establishes additional requirements related to operating environment, safety requirements, system dependability, and audio/visual communications for APM systems.

It is the intent of this standard that tiered levels of functionality, and interoperability between equipment provided by multiple vendors, are facilitated to the extent required by the authority having jurisdiction. All CBTC systems shall include ATP functions.

# 4.4 Train configurations

A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a variety of train configurations, including the following:

a) Fixed-length unidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units  
b) Fixed-length bidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units  
c) Variable-length unidirectional trains  
d) Variable-length bidirectional trains

A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a mixed fleet of trains, where specific trains, and/or classes of trains, have different performance characteristics.

# 4.5 Train operating modes

CBTC-equipped trains may be operated by either a single person or a multi-person crew. A CBTC system may also be required to support operation of trains without crews.

For operation of trains with crews, the train operator will typically be stationed in the lead car of the train and will be responsible for moving the train from station to station. With a multi-person crew, the conductor(s) will normally operate from conductor position(s) within the train to operate the train's doors. A CBTC system shall support single-person train operation by combining the conductor and train operator display information on the train operator's display. For multi-person crews, conductor display information shall also be provided on separate conductor displays.

For the purposes of this standard, operation of trains without crews includes both unattended and driverless train operations. With unattended train operations, there would normally be no crew member onboard the train. With driverless train operations, there may be a crew member onboard the train, but normally not in the driving cab. This crew member, if present, would normally have no responsibility for operation of the train except for failure recovery.

CBTC-equipped trains (including CBTC-equipped maintenance vehicles) shall be capable of operating in various modes, depending on whether the train is operating in CBTC territory or non-CBTC territory, and depending on the operational status of the train-borne and/or wayside CBTC equipment.

Mixed-mode operation shall also be considered a normal operating mode, to the extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction. Mixed-mode operation is defined as the simultaneous operation within CBTC territory of CBTC-equipped trains and trains that are not equipped with functional train-borne CBTC equipment (including maintenance vehicles). Mixed-mode operation may be used in one or more of the following ways:

a) A regularly scheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory  
b) An infrequent, unscheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory  
c) During the transition period only, as a new CBTC system is cut-in  
d) As a result of train-borne CBTC equipment failures

# 4.5.1 Normal train operating modes in CBTC territory

# 4.5.1.1 CBTC-equipped trains

CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory shall operate, within ATP limits, under the protection of the CBTC system. The train shall be capable of being controlled manually by a train operator or automatically by the CBTC system (supervised by the train operator, if present), as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. When operating automatically, some functions (such as door operation and train departure initiation) may continue to be the responsibility of the train operator and/or conductor(s), if present.

# 4.5.1.2 Non-CBTC-equipped trains

Trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment that are operating in CBTC territory shall operate under the protection of an auxiliary wayside system and/or operating procedures, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 4.5.2 Failure mode train operations in CBTC territory

For light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail applications operating with crews, it is an operational requirement to continue to move trains safely in the event of CBTC equipment and/or data communication failures,

possibly at reduced operating speeds and/or increased operating headways when compared to normal train operations. As a consequence, a CBTC system shall be designed to support degraded modes of operation in the event of failure and to continue to provide ATP with minimum reliance on adherence to operating procedures. This shall be achieved through functional elements of the CBTC system itself, an auxiliary wayside system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction), or a combination of both systems.

For fully automated people mover applications operating without crews, the extent to which the CBTC system shall be designed to support degraded modes of operation in the event of failure shall be as defined by the authority having jurisdiction, and may include an ability to remotely reset train-borne equipment and the ability to support automatic push/pull train recovery, as well as the ability to support manual train operations and alternative routing strategies.

For all applications, a fall-back plan, based on failure analysis and operating procedures, shall identify train operating modes that will take advantage of the degraded modes of operation and recovery capabilities of the CBTC system. The goal of the plan shall be to eliminate hazards to passengers and staff in accordance with 5.3, while continuing to provide passenger service.

Specifically, failure mode train operations in CBTC territory shall address those CBTC system failures affecting the following:

a) All trains operating within a particular area of control  
b) A particular train operating within any area of control

# 4.5.2.1 CBTC system failures affecting all trains operating within a particular area of control

In the event of a CBTC system failure that affects all CBTC-equipped trains operating within a particular area of control within CBTC territory (e.g., wayside CBTC equipment or wayside-to-train data communications failure), trains shall have the capability to provide continued safe operations under the control of a train operator, and

a) With the protection of an auxiliary wayside system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or  
b) Through strict adherence to operating procedures; or  
c) A combination of both items a) and b).

When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within individual train-borne CBTC equipment shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.

# 4.5.2.2 CBTC system failures affecting a particular train operating within any area of control

In the event of a CBTC system failure affecting a particular CBTC-equipped train operating within any area of control within CBTC territory (e.g., train-borne CBTC equipment failure), that train shall be capable of continued safe operations under the control of a train operator, and

a) With the protection of an auxiliary wayside system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or  
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or  
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures; or  
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).

When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within wayside CBTC equipment and within other train-borne CBTC equipment shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.

# 4.5.3 Normal train operating modes in non-CBTC territory

For the purposes of this standard, non-CBTC territory is defined as any territory that is not equipped with wayside CBTC equipment fully compatible with the train-borne CBTC equipment.

CBTC equipment installed on trains operating in non-CBTC territory shall include the necessary capabilities to support transitions into CBTC territory. In addition, if specified by the authority having jurisdiction, trainborne CBTC equipment may also perform other ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, such as limiting train speed and/or providing zero speed detection.

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train-borne CBTC equipment operating in non-CBTC territory may also interface with wayside equipment that is not fully compatible with the train-borne CBTC equipment. In no case, however, shall the train-borne CBTC equipment provide an indication of standard CBTC operation when operating in non-CBTC territory, unless the applicable authority or authorities having jurisdiction over the train-borne and wayside equipment have ensured that standard CBTC operation is supported by the integrated train-borne and wayside systems.

# 4.5.4 Failure mode train operations in non-CBTC territory

Except where specified to perform certain ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, failure of the train-borne CBTC equipment shall have minimal impact on train operation. The failure shall be indicated to the train operator, if present.

# 4.6 Entering/exiting CBTC territory

# 4.6.1 Entering into CBTC territory

A CBTC system shall have precise knowledge of the limits of CBTC territory and shall include the capability to perform verification checks of the train-borne CBTC equipment prior to entering CBTC territory. The checks shall be performed sufficiently in advance of entry into CBTC territory to verify the proper operation of the train-borne CBTC equipment (including any wayside CBTC equipment dependencies).

If the verification check is passed, an indication to this effect shall be provided. Under normal circumstances and subject to ATP constraints, it shall not be necessary for a train to come to a stop when entering CBTC territory unless required for other operational reasons.

In the event that the verification check fails, an indication of the CBTC system failure shall be provided, and train operation may revert to the auxiliary wayside signal system if available or to operating rules if no auxiliary wayside signal system is provided.

The results of the verification checks shall be displayed on the ATS user interface. For trains operating with crews, the results of the verification checks shall also be indicated to the train operator.

# 4.6.2 Exiting from CBTC territory

For trains operating with crews, prior to exiting CBTC territory, a CBTC system may provide a visual indication to the train operator of time and/or distance until the train will be exiting the CBTC territory. When known by the CBTC system, the train operator may also receive an indication of the type of train control system into which the train will be traversing.

NOTE—Indications to the train operator may not be required if the transition between CBTC territory and non-CBTC territory is operationally transparent to the train operator.

Under normal circumstances and subject to ATP constraints, it shall not be necessary for a train to come to a stop when exiting CBTC territory unless required for other operational reasons.

# 4.7 Train operating speeds

A CBTC system shall be capable of meeting the performance and functional requirements of this standard, over the full range of possible train operating speeds specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 5. Performance requirements

# 5.1 CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways

The required design and operating headways (i.e., the minimum and scheduled headways) for both normal and reverse directions shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. Headway may be specified as uninterfered and/or interfered.

In all cases, the design headway shall be constrained by the safe train separation requirements and the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1.

In the case of an uninterfered headway, a train speed profile shall not be affected by a preceding train. All trains shall, therefore, perform at the maximum allowed speed, depending on the civil speed limits and the acceleration and braking capabilities of the trains themselves. Operation at uninterfered headways facilitates a minimum end-to-end trip time for a given set of station dwell times.

Headways may be reduced (at the expense of increased trip times) with an interfered headway where a train speed profile is affected by a preceding train such that a following train decelerates on the approach to a station and enters the station area at a reduced speed. Interfered headway may also be specified to support multiple berthings at a station platform.

The design headway for a particular line and a particular set of vehicles involves many factors that are outside the control of the CBTC system (e.g., track alignment, gradients, civil speed limits, train acceleration and braking rates, station dwell times, terminal track configurations, driver reaction times). These factors shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. This standard addresses only those CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways, of which the most significant are the following:

a) Location (both accuracy of measured end-of-train locations and resolution of movement authority limits for a given train), including the frequency at which location reports and movement authorities are updated.  
b) Speed, including both accuracy of speed measurement and resolution of speed limits established for a given train at a given location.  
c) Communications delays, including nominal and worst-case transmission times of command/status messages between wayside and train, and vice versa. (Command/status messages include, for example, messages related to movement authority updates and/or location report updates.)  
d) CBTC equipment reaction times, including maximum error accumulation, for both wayside and train-borne equipment, and for various operating modes, as applicable. (CBTC equipment reaction times include, for example, the time required to establish new movement authority limits following location report updates, the time to establish new movement authority limits through an interlocking, and the time to determine a new ATP profile following movement authority update.)  
e) CBTC system performance limitations (e.g., the maximum number of trains that can be processed by the CBTC system, within a given area of control).  
f) CBTC automatic speed regulation algorithm.

Typical values for the CBTC parameters in items a) through e) are given in Annex C.

# 5.2 CBTC factors contributing to achievable trip times

Trip time requirements shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, consistent with train performance and track alignment characteristics.

The minimum end-to-end trip times for a defined set of station dwell times will result from uninterfered headway speed profiles. The CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways, as identified in 5.1, will also be factors contributing to the minimum achievable trip times.

# 5.3 System safety requirements

# 5.3.1 CBTC System Safety Program requirements

A System Safety Program shall be instituted during the CBTC system planning/design phase and shall continue throughout the system life cycle. The CBTC System Safety Program shall emphasize the prevention of accidents by identifying and resolving hazards in a systematic manner. A CBTC System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) shall be developed for each CBTC application. The CBTC SSPP shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of E.1 of Annex E or the requirements of the American Public Transit Association's Manual [B1] or equivalent requirements, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction.

Implementation of the CBTC SSPP shall specifically recognize configuration management issues, given the importance of software and hardware configuration control in maintaining system safety.

# 5.3.2 CBTC hazard identification and risk assessment process

Hazard analyses shall be employed during the design of a CBTC system to assist in the identification and evaluation of potential hazards to assess their likelihood and severity and to document their resolution. As a minimum, a preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) shall be conducted for each new CBTC system project. Other detailed analyses, including system/subsystem hazard analyses, failure modes, effects and criticality analyses, fault tree analyses, and operational and support hazard analyses, shall also be conducted if mandated by the CBTC SSPP. These analyses shall be conducted in accordance with E.2, E.3, E.4, and E.5 of Annex E or equivalent requirements, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction.

All hazards identified through the CBTC System Safety Program shall be assessed in terms of the severity or consequence of the hazard and the probability of occurrence. This shall be accomplished in general accordance with the criteria outlined in E.6 of Annex E or the equivalent, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction. Risk assessment estimates shall be used as the basis in the decision-making process to determine whether individual system or subsystem hazards shall be eliminated, mitigated, or accepted. This process shall include full documentation of the hazard resolution activities.

Hazards shall be resolved through a design process that emphasizes the elimination of the hazard. The effectiveness of the hazard resolution strategies and countermeasures shall be monitored to determine that no new hazards are introduced. In addition, whenever substantive changes are made to the system, analyses shall be conducted to identify and resolve any new hazards.

As a minimum, a CBTC system shall address the following critical/catastrophic system hazards through the implementation of the ATP functions defined in 6.1:

a) Train-to-train collisions (rear-end, sideswipe, head-on); hazard to be addressed through train separation assurance (see 6.1.2), rollback protection (see 6.1.4), parted consist protection (see 6.1.6), route interlocking protection (see 6.1.11), and traffic direction reversal interlocks (see 6.1.12)  
b) Train-to-structure collisions; hazard to be addressed through end-of-track protection (see 6.1.5) and restricted route protection (see 6.1.16)  
c) Train derailments; hazard to be addressed through overspeed protection (see 6.1.3), route interlocking protection (see 6.1.11), and (where specified by the authority having jurisdiction) broken rail detection (see 6.1.14)  
d) Collisions between trains and highway vehicles (where highway crossing at grade exists within the limits of CBTC territory); hazard to be addressed through grade-crossing warning devices that may include interfaces to the CBTC system (see 6.1.15)  
e) Hazards to work crews and work trains; hazards to be addressed through CBTC work zone protection functions (see 6.1.13)  
f) Hazards to passengers associated with train movement with train doors open; hazards to be addressed through interface between the CBTC system and the train door system (where required by the authority having jurisdiction) to provide door opening control protection interlocks (see 6.1.8), zero speed detection (see 6.1.7), and departure interlocks (see 6.1.9)  
g) Hazards associated with collisions with objects on the track; hazards to be addressed through interfaces between the CBTC system and intrusion detection devices (where specified by the authority having jurisdiction) (see 6.1.16)

# 5.3.3 CBTC vital functions

To eliminate or control to a level acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction those hazards judged to be unacceptable or undesirable through the risk assessment process of 5.3.2, a CBTC system shall include, as a minimum, the vital functions identified in 6.1.

All vital functions of a CBTC system shall be designed and implemented in accordance with fail-safe principles. Documentation of the means used, and proof that fail-safe principles have been met and the mean time between hazardous event (MTBHE) requirements of 5.3.4 have been satisfied, shall be required for every CBTC system.

Verification that the processor-based portions of a CBTC system meet these minimum system safety requirements shall be completed in accordance with IEEE Std 1483-2000.6

# 5.3.4 Quantitative CBTC safety performance requirements

For any CBTC system application, the CBTC wayside and train-borne equipment located within any contiguous portion of a one-way route that can be traversed by a train traveling at the specified maximum authorized speed for one hour or less shall have a total calculated aggregate MTBHE (total of all critical and catastrophic hazards) of at least  $10^{9}$  operating hours. This includes the maximum number of other trains that can be located in this contiguous portion of a one-way route under the specified peak operating headway. System safety documentation shall support these calculations and substantiate the methodology used to arrive at the result. For the purposes of MTBHE calculations, a hazardous event shall include, as a minimum, the occurrence of any of the specific hazards identified in 5.3.2.

NOTE—If the end-to-end trip time for a given route is greater than  $1\mathrm{h}$ , the MTBHE requirement for that route would be adjusted proportionately. As an illustrative example, if the specified end-to-end trip time (per 5.2) for a given one-way route is  $2\mathrm{h}$ , and if the route includes 4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment, and if a maximum of 10 trains can be operating on the route at a given time (when operating at the specified peak headway, per 5.1), then the MTBHE of the combined 4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment and 10 sets of train-borne CBTC equipment on that route would be at least  $0.5 \times 10^{9}$  operating hours.

# 5.3.5 Basic safety design principles

# 5.3.5.1 Normal transit system operations with no CBTC hardware failures

A CBTC system shall respond safely and correctly perform all ATP functions within the normal range of inputs and other operating and environmental conditions.

All conditions necessary for the existence of any permissive state or action shall be verified to be present before the permissive state or action is initiated by a CBTC system. The requisite conditions shall be verified to be continuously present for the permissive state or action to be maintained.

System safety shall not depend on the correctness of actions taken or procedures used by operating personnel.

Procedures shall not be considered a substitute for safety functions that are to be vested in specific CBTC components or equipment.

# 5.3.5.2 Abnormal transit system operations with no CBTC hardware failures

A CBTC system shall respond safely under conditions of abnormal system loading, abnormal/improper inputs, and other abnormal external influences such as electrical, mechanical, and environmental factors.

# 5.3.5.3 Response to CBTC hardware failures

A CBTC system shall respond safely under conditions of credible hardware failure.

NOTE—The AREMA Communications & Signals Manual, Part 17.3.3 [B2], provides examples of credible hardware failures.

Failure to perform a logical operation or absence of a logical input, output, or decision shall not cause an unsafe condition, i.e., system safety shall not depend upon the occurrence of an action or logical decision.

Hazard analyses shall consider all credible CBTC hardware failure modes. Justification shall be provided for conceivable failure modes that are not considered credible. The effect of each credible CBTC failure mode shall be classified as either self-revealing or non-self-revealing, as follows:

No credible single point CBTC hardware failure, whether self-revealing or non-self-revealing, shall cause an unsafe condition.  
No credible CBTC hardware failure in combination with one or more non-self-revealing failure shall cause an unsafe condition. In the instance of a non-self-revealing failure, a subsequent failure shall not be considered independent.  
The probability of a critical or catastrophic hazard arising as a result of combinations of simultaneous independent self-revealing failures shall be considered in the calculated CBTC MTBHE.

# 5.3.5.4 Recovery from CBTC hardware failures

A combination of functional elements of the CBTC system itself, an auxiliary wayside system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction), and/or operating procedures shall provide for the safety of train movement under failure conditions, including failure recovery.

# 5.4 System assurance requirements

# 5.4.1 General

The ability of a CBTC system to accomplish the functional requirements of this standard, under normal conditions and under conditions of equipment failure, is of paramount importance to the authority having jurisdiction. This subclause establishes qualitative availability, reliability, and maintainability criteria for CBTC systems and equipment in order to meet or exceed the on-time performance and fleet availability objectives of the authority having jurisdiction, and thereby minimize delays experienced by passengers. In addressing CBTC equipment failures, a distinction shall be made between the following failure types:

a) Type 1: Those failures, or combination of failures, that impact on-time performance of the transit system.  
b) Type 2: Those failures, or combination of failures, that do not impact on-time performance of the transit system, but do result in some other loss of specified CBTC functionality.  
c) Type 3: Those failures that do not impact on-time performance of the transit system or result in a loss of any specified CBTC functionality (e.g., because of equipment redundancy).

The CBTC system availability requirement (see 5.4.2) shall include consideration of all Type 1 failures, as well as the mean time to restore service (MTTRS) for Type 1 failures.

The CBTC system mean time between functional failure (MTBFF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include consideration of all Type 1 and Type 2 failures.

The CBTC system mean time between failure (MTBF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include consideration of all Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 failures.

While system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF predictions traditionally consider only hardware failures, measurements of achieved system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF shall also consider software errors (i.e., software fails to perform intended function) as well as hardware failures.

The following general recommended practices apply:

1) Components and materials should be selected and appropriate standards of quality control and test procedures should be employed to ensure the lowest practical hardware failure rates for individual items of CBTC equipment (i.e., maximize the hardware portion of the system MTBF).  
2) Unless non-redundant equipment is sufficiently reliable to satisfy the overall system availability requirements, appropriate levels of equipment redundancy should be employed such that the failure of a single component, processor, or device will not render the CBTC system unavailable or an operationally critical function nonoperative (i.e., maximize the system MTBFF).  
3) A CBTC system should incorporate degraded modes of operation to minimize the operational impacts of equipment failures and to permit train movements to continue safely (i.e., maximize system availability).  
4) CBTC system downtime or unavailability of an operationally critical function should be minimized through the use of local and remote diagnostic capabilities and appropriate operating and maintenance procedures [i.e., minimize mean time to repair (MTTR)].

# 5.4.2 System availability requirements

Quantitative CBTC system availability requirements shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction with appropriate consideration of the impacts of CBTC system and subsystem failures on the operation of the transit system. Typical methods for defining CBTC system availability are provided in Annex F.

As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability analysis/modeling shall be used to predict the system availability for a given CBTC system configuration, based on equipment reliability/ maintainability calculations, equipment redundancy provisions, and other defined assumptions.

As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability demonstration tests shall be performed to determine actual CBTC system availability over a defined period, to a given confidence level.

# 5.4.3 Equipment reliability requirements

Quantitative CBTC system and subsystem MTBF and MTBFF requirements shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction, consistent with the CBTC system availability requirement of 5.4.2.

# 5.4.3.1 Design life

CBTC equipment shall have a design life of  $30\mathrm{y}$

NOTE—The ability of a CBTC system to remain in operation to the end of its design life will be driven largely by long-term availability of spare parts. Specific requirements with respect to spare part availability shall be defined by the authority having jurisdiction and do not form part of this standard.

# 5.4.4 Equipment maintainability requirements

A CBTC system shall be designed to minimize required maintenance (both preventive and corrective) by maximizing the system MTBF and by including features that provide for ease of maintenance by maintenance personnel.

The mean time to repair/replace a failed piece of in-service CBTC equipment (i.e., first-level repair) shall include on-site diagnostics, the replacement of failed components, and the testing of the repaired units, subsystem, or system, but shall exclude travel time to the site. A separate MTTR requirement may be defined for second-level repair (i.e., shop repair of a failed line replaceable unit).

The first-level MTTR shall be no greater than  $30\mathrm{min}$ . The second level MTTR, if specified, shall be no greater than  $2\mathrm{h}$ .

Achievable repair times will be driven by equipment diagnostic provisions and available test equipment, as well as the quality of the maintenance manuals and training. A CBTC system shall, therefore, include maintenance and diagnostic capabilities to detect and react to CBTC equipment failures. This shall include remote diagnostics capabilities as well as local built-in test equipment and other fault displays for troubleshooting, and the timely identification of failed components and functions.

Data logging capabilities shall also be provided in wayside and train-borne CBTC equipment. The logged data shall be capable of being analyzed to be able to recreate the sequence of events leading to an incident. This will allow maintenance personnel to identify the cause of any failure and/or mis-operation of CBTC equipment that cannot be identified by the in-built diagnostics of the equipment. The scope of logged CBTC events shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction.

A CBTC system design shall include capabilities to permit periodic verification of ATP hardware, software, and data, including verification of correct response to interference on the train-to-wayside data link. To the extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall also include capabilities to facilitate modifications (by the user) to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and applications software. The supplier of the CBTC system shall identify to the authority having jurisdiction those specific changes to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and applications software that will have no impact on system safety.

# WARNING

Changes made to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and application software, other than those identified by the supplier as not impacting safety, can affect safe system operation. Prior to implementing any such changes, applicable hazard analyses of 5.3.2 shall be reassessed to verify that the modified system will still meet all requirements of this standard including, but not limited to, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5. Changes shall be implemented in accordance with the CBTC SSPP of 5.3.1.

# 5.5 Environmental requirements

Train-borne CBTC equipment shall comply with the requirements of IEEE Std 1478-2001.

Wayside CBTC equipment shall comply with the requirements of IEEE P1582/D1.0.

# 6. Functional requirements

A CBTC system shall include the capability for providing ATP, ATO, and ATS functions. ATP functions shall provide fail-safe protection against collisions, excessive speed, and other hazardous conditions. ATP functions shall have precedence over both the ATO and ATS functions. ATO functions shall control basic operations that would otherwise be performed by a train operator and shall do so within the protection limits imposed by ATP. ATS functions shall provide system status information and the means to monitor and override the automatic control for various functions of the system.

The CBTC train-to-wayside communications interface shall be sufficient to support all required ATP, ATO, and ATS functions. The data link shall provide continuous geographic coverage within CBTC territory and shall support train operations in tunnels, tubes, and cuts, on elevated structures, and at grade. The data link shall support bidirectional data transfer and shall exhibit sufficiently low latency to support the defined performance requirements. The data link shall include a protocol structure to support safe, timely, and secure delivery of train control messages.

# 6.1 ATP functions

All ATP functions shall be vital functions and shall be designed and implemented in accordance with 5.3.

A CBTC system shall be capable of providing bidirectional ATP.

# 6.1.1 Train location/train speed determination

# 6.1.1.1 CBTC train location/train speed determination

CBTC train location/train speed determination shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

A CBTC system shall establish the location, speed, and travel direction of each CBTC-equipped train operating in CBTC territory.

CBTC train location determination shall safely and accurately establish the location of both the front and rear of the train. The CBTC train location determination function shall provide sufficient train location resolution and accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Train location resolution and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

The CBTC train location determination function shall be self-initializing and shall automatically detect and establish the location of each CBTC-equipped train as it enters CBTC territory and on recovery from CBTC equipment failures, without requiring manual input of train location or train length data.

The CBTC train speed determination function shall provide sufficient speed measurement resolution and accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Speed measurement resolution and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

A CBTC system shall compensate for the effects of measurement inaccuracies on train location and speed determination. Specifically, if the CBTC train location/speed determination function is dependent upon wheel rotation, the CBTC system shall correct for position errors induced by the slipping or sliding of wheels and shall correct for position errors caused by variation in wheel size due to wear, trueing, or replacement.

# 6.1.1.2 Secondary train location determination

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, an auxiliary wayside system may provide secondary train location determination to establish if a section of track is occupied by one or more trains, including trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment. It will not be necessary to determine the location of non-CBTC-equipped trains, or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment, to the same accuracy as CBTC-equipped trains.

# 6.1.2 Safe train separation

Safe train separation shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

Safe train separation shall be provided between all trains operating in CBTC territory, whether or not the trains are CBTC equipped.

A CBTC system shall provide safe train separation between CBTC-equipped trains. Safe train separation shall be based upon the principle of an instantaneous (brick wall) stop of the preceding train.

For mixed-mode operation (see 4.5), safe train separation shall be provided through an auxiliary wayside system and/or through strict adherence to operating procedures, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

If secondary train location determination is provided through an auxiliary wayside system (see 6.1.1.2), then for a CBTC-equipped train following a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment, a CBTC system shall limit the movement authority of the following train to the boundary of the section of track occupied by the non-CBTC-equipped or failed train. If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC system may further limit the movement authority to the route entry point of a route occupied by the non-CBTC-equipped train or failed train.

The CBTC safe train separation function shall consist of the following:

a) The calculation of the ATP profile (i.e., the profile of safe speed as a function of train location), derived from fixed ATP data (e.g., permanent speed limits) and variable ATP data (e.g., temporary speed limits and movement authority limit)  
b) The supervision and enforcement of the ATP profile calculated by the CBTC system

The ATP profile shall be governed by a safe braking model (see 6.1.2.1) and shall ensure that under no circumstances (including failures) will the movement authority limit be exceeded by a CBTC-equipped train.

The movement authority limit shall be the most restrictive of the following:

The rear of a CBTC-equipped train ahead (as determined by the CBTC train location function in 6.1.1.1), with allowance for any location uncertainty  
The boundary of a section of track occupied by a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment (as determined by an auxiliary wayside system, if provided, per 6.1.1.2)  
The end-of-track (see 6.1.5)  
The entrance to an interlocking, when the route is not verified as aligned and locked (see 6.1.11)  
The boundary of a section of track with an opposing traffic direction established (see 6.1.12)  
The boundary of a blocked track (see 6.1.13)  
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the entrance to a highway grade crossing where warning devices are not confirmed to be operating (see 6.1.15)  
The entrance to a route that is detected to be unsafe for train movement (see 6.1.16)

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC safe train separation function shall support automatic close-up of trains and automatic coupling and uncoupling of trains in designated areas.

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to bypass the CBTC safe train separation function to allow a train, under the control of a train operator, to travel beyond its movement authority limit (e.g., at a restricted speed), for failure recovery purposes.

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to pull back (i.e., make more restrictive) a movement authority limit previously granted to a train. If the train were approaching or braking toward the original movement authority limit, the train may be in violation of the new ATP profile. Under such circumstances, a CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application. The brake application may be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake application, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction (see 6.1.3).

# 6.1.2.1 Safe braking model

A safe braking model shall be developed for each CBTC application.

The safe braking model shall, as a minimum, include consideration of the following:

a) Location uncertainty of lead train (including rollback tolerance)  
b) Location uncertainty of following train  
c) Train length  
d) Train configuration (see 4.4)  
e) Allowable overspeed permitted by the CBTC system  
f) Maximum CBTC speed measurement error  
g) CBTC system reaction times and latencies  
h) Maximum train acceleration rate possible at the time an overspeed condition is detected by the CBTC system  
i) Worst-case reaction times to disable the propulsion system and apply the emergency brakes following detection of an overspeed condition by the CBTC system  
j) Guaranteed emergency brake rate (GEBR)  
k) Grade

The GEBR shall be the minimum emergency brake rate achieved by a train on level tangent track under the range of environmental conditions and worst-case credible latent brake equipment failure modes, which can be anticipated to exist for that train in the specific application. The GEBR shall be specified by the authority

having jurisdiction and shall include consideration of maximum passenger load (plus snow and ice load if applicable), minimum anticipated adhesion levels, and maximum design tailwind.

A typical safe braking model is provided in Annex D.

A CBTC system shall have the capability to support multiple safe braking models to accommodate different train acceleration/braking rates for different classes and configurations of trains operating simultaneously within CBTC territory and to accommodate automatic close-up and automatic coupling/uncoupling capabilities, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A CBTC system shall incorporate appropriate protection to ensure that the correct safe braking model is applied for a given train at a given location.

# 6.1.3 Overspeed protection and brake assurance

Overspeed protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

In establishing, supervising, and enforcing the ATP profile, as governed by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1, a CBTC system shall ensure that under no circumstances, including failures, will the train's actual speed exceed its safe speed. The safe speed shall be derived by considering the most restrictive of the following:

a) The permanent speed limits on sections of track within the ATP profile  
b) Any temporary speed restrictions on sections of track within the ATP profile  
c) Any permanent speed restriction applicable to the particular class or configuration of train  
d) Any speed restrictions enforced on the train because of train-borne failure conditions  
e) The maximum speed that would allow the train to stop safely prior to the limit of the train's movement authority or to slow down sufficiently to meet appropriate permanent or temporary speed restrictions upon entering that section of track

Speed limits and restrictions shall apply when any portion of the train is within the speed limit area.

Speed limit/speed restriction resolution parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

Enforcement of the calculated ATP profile shall be achieved by comparing the CBTC-determined train speed with the ATP profile speed at the CBTC-determined train location. If the ATP profile speed at that location is exceeded, the CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application.

The brake application may be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake application, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. In the latter case, a CBTC system shall monitor the achieved brake rate to ensure an acceptable brake rate is achieved within a predetermined time frame; if not, it shall immediately apply the emergency brakes. The safe braking model shall include appropriate allowances for reaction times associated with this brake assurance function.

# 6.1.4 Rollback protection

Rollback protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

A CBTC system shall monitor actual train travel direction and shall compare measured travel direction with the CBTC established/commanded direction of traffic. Train motion against traffic for more than a specified rollback tolerance shall result in the CBTC system initiating an emergency brake application. Rollback detection criteria for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

# 6.1.5 End-of-track protection

End-of-track protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration that permits the operation of trains up to, or in close proximity to, an end-of-track terminus.

End-of-track protection shall be incorporated into, or function in conjunction with, overspeed protection to prevent trains from over-traveling the end-of-track or, if buffers are specified, to prevent trains from exceeding the design limits for impact with an end-of-track buffer. End-of-track protection design shall be based on the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1.

# 6.1.6 Parted consist protection and coupling and uncoupling of trains

Where separate vehicles can be coupled together in a consist of two or more vehicles or units to form a train, a CBTC system shall have the capability of detecting and protecting parted trains. Parted consist protection shall be required regardless of whether the individual vehicles or units are considered to be permanently coupled or whether they are routinely uncoupled for maintenance or operational purposes.

A CBTC system shall also support operating requirements for coupling and uncoupling of trains, including automatic update of the consist length within the CBTC system.

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may assume a fixed, worst-case, maximum train length for a given class of trains operating in CBTC territory, with a reliance on operating procedures to ensure this maximum train length is not exceeded.

# 6.1.7 Zero speed detection

Zero speed detection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration and shall be in accordance with the requirements of 5.10 of IEEE Std 1475-1999.

Zero speed detection criteria for typical CBTC systems and applications are included in Annex C.

# 6.1.8 Door opening control protection interlocks

If trains are operated with crews, door open control protection interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the option of the authority having jurisdiction. For operation of trains without crews, door open control protection interlocks shall be mandatory. These interlocks, if provided, shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfied prior to enabling the opening of the train doors (and platform doors, if fitted):

a) The train is "properly aligned" at a designated stopping point, where the designated stopping point and required tolerances shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.  
b) There is a platform (or other location specified by the authority having jurisdiction) on the side of the train for which the door opening is allowed.  
c) Zero speed is detected, in accordance with 6.1.7.  
d) The train is constrained against motion.

Selective door open enable shall be possible for those applications where the train length exceeds the platform length.

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the preceding door open control protection interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

# 6.1.9 Departure interlocks

If trains are operated with crews, departure interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the option of the authority having jurisdiction. For operation of trains without crews, departure interlocks shall be mandatory. These interlocks, if provided, shall prevent a stationary train from moving (e.g., by disabling the propulsion system) unless all train doors (and platform edge doors, if fitted) are properly closed and locked, in accordance with the requirements of 5.14 of IEEE Std 1475-1999.

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the preceding departure interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

# 6.1.10 Emergency braking

The train's emergency brake system shall be capable of bringing the train to a stop within the assured stopping distance determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1. Specific criteria for resetting the emergency brakes to allow normal operation to resume shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. If conditions (as determined by ATP) are not correct for train movement, the emergency braking shall remain applied regardless of any reset signals or actions, except that facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the ATP functions for that train to permit manual train operation for failure recovery purposes. Use of such facilities shall require strict adherence to operating procedures to ensure the safety of train movements. If correct ATP conditions exist after the emergency brakes have been reset, the train shall be permitted to move or continue to move; however, if the actual train speed again exceeds the ATP profile speed or a subsequent malfunction occurs, emergency braking shall be applied as before.

# 6.1.11 Route interlocking

A CBTC system shall provide route interlocking functions equivalent to conventional interlocking practice to prevent train collisions and derailments. These functions shall include locking of the route in advance of the train entering the interlocking (time or approach locking) and once the train is in the interlocking (route locking). The switches shall also be locked when the track section containing the switch is occupied by a train (detector locking). Locking functions shall also apply to moveable bridges and similar right-of-way apparatus. Sectional release (of routes behind a train) may be provided where specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

NOTE—The AREMA Communications & Signals Manual, Sections 2 and 16 [B2], provides examples of recommended practices for use in interlocking design.

A movement authority shall not be advanced into an interlocking until the appropriate route is set and locked. Once a movement authority has been advanced through an interlocking, the affected route shall not be released and conflicting routes cleared unless either the train has traveled through and is verified clear of the interlocking or the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect.

Where an auxiliary wayside system is specified by the authority having jurisdiction, interlocking functions may be provided by separate interlocking equipment, which is based on train position established by a secondary train detection subsystem. In this case, a CBTC system shall interface to and may modify the conventional interlocking functions based on train position established by the CBTC train location determination function, to safely enable the enhanced performance capabilities of a CBTC system to be realized.

# 6.1.11.1 CBTC interfaces to a separate interlocking

Where an auxiliary wayside system or separate interlocking is specified, a CBTC system shall interface to interlockings as follows:

a) Time or approach locking shall apply, except in the event of a route being canceled for an approaching CBTC train (i.e., the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect). In this case, if the train is greater than a safe braking distance from the entrance to the interlocking (as determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1) or the train stops prior to entering the interlocking, the route shall be released without running further time.  
b) Traffic locking may be overridden so that CBTC-equipped trains may move in opposing directions within their respective movement authorities on the same track at the same time.  
c) Wayside signals and their aspects may be provided as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A CBTC system may override the conventional aspects to cause the signal(s) to display CBTC aspect(s) only to CBTC-equipped trains.

# 6.1.11.2 Responses to CBTC train location failures

In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function, route locking shall remain in effect until the train is proven to be clear of the interlocking by the CBTC system (i.e., the train is subsequently determined to be clear of the interlocking limits), or through operating procedures, or a combination of both approaches.

In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function in an interlocking where train location is also capable of being detected by means of a secondary system, CBTC system overrides of the interlocking functions may be released, provided route and other locking functions are maintained by the auxiliary wayside system so as to prevent the movement of a switch in front of and under the train until the train is proven to be clear of the interlocking.

# 6.1.11.3 Response to loss of switch indication

In the event of a loss of switch indication once a movement authority has been issued through an interlocking, a CBTC system shall pull back the movement authority to the entrance of the interlocking. If a train is already within a safe braking distance of the switch, the CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application (see 6.1.2).

# 6.1.12 Traffic direction reversal interlocks

Traffic direction reversal interlocks shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system application requiring bidirectional operations, in order to support reversal of train direction at terminal stations and to support intermediate turn backs and shuttle modes of operation, for example.

It shall not be possible to extend the movement authority for a train into a section of track where an opposing traffic direction has already been established.

A reversal of traffic direction within a section of track shall not be possible unless

a) All trains within that section of track are at zero speed and constrained against motion in the original traffic direction, and  
b) The movement authorities for all trains outside of that section of track do not extend into the section and are constrained from being extended into the section in the original traffic direction.

# 6.1.13 Work zone protection

A CBTC system shall not grant movement authorities to trains to operate into out-of-service (blocked) tracks or through switches blocked in other than the required position and shall enforce restricted speeds on approach to and through defined work zones (see 6.3.7.4). A CBTC system may also include capabilities to preclude ATO mode of operation through a work zone.

# 6.1.14 Broken rail detection

Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to an auxiliary wayside system for purposes of broken rail detection. A CBTC system's reaction to a detected broken rail shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 6.1.15 Highway grade-crossing warning

Where highway crossings at grade exist within the limits of CBTC territory and where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to grade-crossing warning devices to permit control of such devices based on CBTC location reports and to coordinate movement authorities through the crossing based on the status from such devices. Specific requirements shall be defined by the authority having jurisdiction and may include the following:

a) Constant (and consistent) warning times, independent of train speed or acceleration/deceleration  
b) For trains making station stops prior to crossings, delayed activation of the warning devices until the train is ready to depart the station  
c) When a train clears a crossing in multiple track areas, continued activation of the warning devices if a second train would have reactivated the devices within a predefined time interval  
d) Advance warning for priority control of traffic lights or other highway signage, in accordance with IEEE Std 1570-2002 and/or the AREMA Communications & Signals Manual, Part 3.1.10 [B2].

# 6.1.16 Restricted route protections

Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall include capabilities to prevent a train from entering a route that is unsafe for movement of that type of train due to mechanical, civil, electrical, or other predefined temporary or permanent conditions of the train or route, or through interfaces to intrusion detection devices, platform edge doors (where fitted), and/or other devices capable of detecting hazards that impact route integrity.

# 6.2 ATO functions

For operation of trains without crews, a CBTC system shall, as a minimum, be capable of providing all of the ATO functions as defined in this subclause, to automatically operate trains in accordance with prescribed operating criteria within the safety constraints imposed by ATP.

For operation of train with crews, the required ATO functions shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

The CBTC wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data communications interface shall be sufficient to support all required ATO functions.

# 6.2.1 Automatic speed regulation

The starting, stopping, and speed regulation of the train as it travels along the track shall be automatically controlled by a CBTC system so that the speed, acceleration, deceleration, and jerk rates are within specified passenger comfort limits (as defined by the authority having jurisdiction) and the train speed is below the overspeed limits imposed by ATP.

Station stopping accuracy shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

A CBTC system shall support multiple ATO speeds, acceleration, and service brake rates in accordance with the train operator (if present) or ATS inputs.

# 6.2.2 Platform berthing control

A CBTC system shall be capable of implementing any of the following platform berthing control modes:

a) Where the platform length is approximately equal to the train length, a CBTC system shall allow a train to enter a station platform only if there is sufficient room to fully berth or if the preceding train has a movement authority that shall allow it to fully leave the platform area and it has begun to move out of the station (i.e., within ATP constraints, train movement shall be controlled to minimize the likelihood of the train coming to a stop when only partially within the station platform limits).  
b) Where the platform length is longer than the train length, a CBTC system shall support multiple stopping positions within the platform area, as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.  
c) Where the platform length supports multiple train berthings, a CBTC system shall allow a train to enter a platform while another train already occupies an alternative berth.  
d) Where the platform length is shorter than the train length, a CBTC system shall support platform berthings consistent with the door opening control protection interlocks of 6.1.8.

# 6.2.3 Door control

A CBTC system shall be capable of automatically controlling train doors (and platform edge doors, where fitted) during passenger boarding and discharging.

As defined by the authority having jurisdiction, automatic door control may be limited to the following:

a) Automatic door opening only (with or without passenger door open requests)  
b) Automatic door closing only  
c) Neither automatic door opening nor closing

If automatic platform edge doors are provided, they shall be controlled as a set with the matching train doors such that the train and matching platform edge doors open and close together. It shall be possible to manually disable the operation of any door set (both the train and the matching platform edge door) without affecting the automatic operation of other door sets. The amount of time the train is to remain in the station with doors open may be established by ATS (6.3.5.1) and automatically controlled by ATO.

# 6.3 ATS functions

# 6.3.1 General

If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC may interface to, or be integrated with, an ATS system. Under such circumstances, and to the extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, CBTC-related ATS functions shall be implemented as defined in this subclause in order to benefit from the characteristics of a CBTC system as defined in 4.1, namely, the availability of the following:

Train location information to a high precision, independent of track circuits  
Continuous wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data communications link  
Train-borne and wayside data processing capabilities

The CBTC-related ATS functions defined in this subclause shall be fully integrated with other conventional ATS functions and other non-ATS functions, as may be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, to support overall service management for the transit system and provide for a single consistent user interface.

The CBTC data communications network, inclusive of the wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data communications interface, shall be sufficient to support those CBTC-related ATS functions specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 6.3.2 ATS user interface

Each ATS user interface shall display all information and implement all control actions, as defined in 6.3, within acceptable latencies as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

Mandatory display data and user information inputs shall be in accordance with IEEE Std 1474.2-2003.

The ATS user shall be able to override any automated CBTC-related ATS functions defined in 6.3.

Certain ATS functions (such as stopping a train en route and the application and removal of temporary speed restrictions, switch/track blocking, or work zones) can potentially introduce system hazards and the specific implementation of these functions shall be considered in the hazard analyses required by 5.3.2. ATS functions are not required to be implemented in a fail-safe manner; however, the hazard analyses shall take into account, as a minimum, the probability of

a) Safety-related commands not being executed when initiated by an ATS user,  
b) The CBTC system prematurely removing safety-related commands initiated by an ATS user,  
c) The CBTC system executing safety-related commands that were not initiated by an ATS user,  
d) Incorrect information being displayed by the CBTC system to the ATS user.

The hazard analyses shall give due consideration of the specific transit application and whether the trains are operated with or without crews.

Control action confirmation shall be provided for any safety-related user interfaces/inputs and functions whose inadvertent implementation could have an adverse operational impact, as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 6.3.3 CBTC train identification and train tracking

The front and rear position of trains shall be tracked based on CBTC train location reports, and the train location shall be displayed on the ATS user interface. Variations in train length may be displayed either proportionally or as a standard length icon supplemented by textual train length data.

# 6.3.4 Train routing

An ATS system shall have the capability to permit CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory to be manually and automatically routed based on CBTC train location reports and in accordance with the train service data, predefined routing rules, and any ATS user-directed service strategy. Where applicable to the specific track configuration, automatic routing shall facilitate the proper merging and diverging of trains at junctions, turn back of trains, the movement of trains from/to storage areas, and the rerouting of trains in response to service disruptions and/or planned outages. Train routes shall be indicated on the ATS user interface and may also be indicated to the train operator and/or conductor, if present, on their displays, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

An ATS system may also include a means to control and limit movement authorities of CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory. CBTC movement authority limits shall be capable of being displayed on the ATS user interface, and any uncommanded reductions of authority limits shall be alarmed. For trains

operated with crews, movement authority limits may also be indicated to the train operator and/or conductor on their displays, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 6.3.5 Automatic train regulation

# 6.3.5.1 Schedule/headway regulation

An ATS system may have the capability to automatically monitor and regulate the performance of CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory, in relation to schedule and/or headway adherence.

An ATS system may include an automatic dispatching function (based on train identities, CBTC train location reports, scheduled and actual headways between trains, and service strategies implemented by authorized ATS users).

Schedule and headway regulation for CBTC-equipped trains shall be by means of dwell time variance (including train holds) and may also be by control of run times between stations (e.g., through adjustments to train acceleration and service brake rates, and speeds), as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. For trains operated with crews, the desired station departure time and desired speed profile between stations may be indicated to the train operator and/or conductor on their displays and, when operating in ATO mode, shall be implemented automatically by a CBTC system using the automatic speed regulation function of 6.2.1.

An ATS system may provide the capability to adjust the train service braking profiles for CBTC-equipped trains (e.g., in response to wet rail conditions). A CBTC system shall coordinate implementation of requested changes in service braking profiles to avoid conditions that would result in an emergency brake application.

# 6.3.5.2 Junction management

An ATS system may include automatic train regulation functions, based on CBTC train location reports, to facilitate appropriate train meets (such as transfers between local and express tracks, and at the merge point between different lines) in order to minimize overall system delays.

# 6.3.5.3 Energy optimization

An ATS system may have the capability to implement energy optimization algorithms for CBTC-equipped trains through the real-time control and coordination of train acceleration, train coasting, and train braking. The priority given to energy optimization versus schedule/headway regulation shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

# 6.3.6 Station stop functions

# 6.3.6.1 Stop train at next station

An ATS system may include the means to direct a single CBTC-equipped train or a group of CBTC-equipped trains to stop at the next station, even if the train is scheduled to bypass that station.

# 6.3.6.3 Skip station stop

An ATS system may include facilities to direct a CBTC-equipped train or group of CBTC-equipped trains to pass through a station or group of stations without stopping. For trains operated with crews, a CBTC system may indicate the skip station information to the train operator and conductor on their displays. In ATO mode, the train shall automatically skip the designated stations.

# 6.3.6.4 Door control inhibit

An ATS system may include facilities to inhibit (and subsequently permit) CBTC control of the train doors, in accordance with 6.2.3.

# 6.3.7 Restricting train operations

# 6.3.7.3 Switch/track blocking

An ATS system shall include facilities to block (and subsequently unblock) a switch, an exit signal, a route entry point, or a section of track within CBTC territory. A CBTC system shall prohibit CBTC-equipped trains from receiving movement authorities over blocked switches not aligned in the required position or into routes and/or sections of track that have been blocked (see 6.1.2 and 6.1.3).

# 6.3.7.4 Work zones

An ATS system shall include facilities to establish (and subsequently remove) temporary work zones for the protection of work crews and work trains.

A CBTC system shall enforce restricted speeds on approach to and through defined work zones (see 6.1.13). For trains operated with crews, information indicating that the restriction is due to a work zone shall be displayed to the train operator and conductor on their displays, and the CBTC system may preclude ATO mode of operation through a work zone.

An ATS system may also provide methods of visually and audibly indicating the approach and direction of trains along the wayside to warn on-track roadway workers in areas where visibility is restricted.

# 6.3.8 Passenger information system interfaces

An ATS system may interface with wayside and/or train-borne passenger information systems to trigger automatic passenger information messages, such as train arrival information, based on CBTC train location reports. Train-borne passenger information system interfaces shall be in accordance with IEEE Std 1477-1998.

# 6.3.9 Fault reporting

# 6.3.9.1 CBTC fault reporting

Failures and out-of-tolerance conditions detected by, or input to, a CBTC system that can impact the on-time performance of the transit system or result in some other loss of specific CBTC functionality may be automatically indicated on the ATS user interface display.

# Typical safe braking model

# D.1 Introduction

A typical safe braking model for CBTC systems is illustrated in Figure D.1.

It should be noted that Figure D.1 is not drawn to scale, but is a simplistic representation to assist in the understanding of a typical CBTC safe braking model. It should also be noted that the safe braking model outlined here is defined for level tangent track and would need to be adjusted for grades.

In Figure D.1, the emergency brake curve is the worst-case, open-loop, speed/distance curve a train will follow once the ATP has initiated an emergency brake application. This emergency brake curve must always be less than or equal to the safe speed curve, where safe speed is defined as the speed above which a critical hazard (derailment or collision) could occur.

In this model, safety factors are accounted for in the emergency brake curve, train position uncertainties, and other additional measurement tolerances incorporated in the CBTC system design, and there is no requirement to add additional safety margins.

The ATP overspeed detection curve is the speed-distance curve that the ATP subsystem uses to immediately initiate an emergency brake application, if the ATP subsystem detects that the measured speed exceeds this curve at the measured train location. When the ATP subsystem has initiated an emergency brake application, the ATP subsystem is no longer in the control loop, and the train will emergency brake at or below the emergency brake curve. The emergency brake curve includes an initial propulsion runaway period, until propulsion is disabled.

The ATP profile curve is the speed-distance curve that is an ATP overspeed allowance below the ATP overspeed detection curve. The ATP profile is the base curve used by the ATP subsystem.

# D.2 Train-borne CBTC response time (A)

In Figure D.1, it is assumed that the CBTC system will measure the train speed and train location (relative to its movement authority limit) and compare the measure speed with the ATP profile speed at that measure location, every  $A$  seconds (worst case).

In Figure D.1, point X represents the situation where the CBTC measured speed is just below the ATP overspeed detection curve at the ATP measure location, i.e., although the ATP measured speed is above the ATP profile, it is still within the ATP overspeed allowance. As such, the CBTC system will not initiate emergency braking.

However, because of worst-case speed and location measurement errors (position uncertainty), it is possible that the actual speed and actual location of the train could be a point Y.

At this point in time, although the train operator and/or ATO subsystem would normally be attempting to bring the train speed down to the ATP profile speed, it is assumed that a failure occurs that results in the train accelerating rather than braking.

$A$  seconds later, this situation will be detected by the CBTC system (point Z in Figure D.1), as the CBTC measured speed will now clearly be in excess of the ATP overspeed detection curve, and the CBTC system will immediately initiate an open-loop emergency brake application.

The speed at point Z therefore represents the maximum speed that a train can achieve above the ATP profile due to CBTC system's worst-case response times and measurement errors.

At this point, the remaining contributions to the safe braking model are determined by the vehicle characteristics only.

# D.3 Propulsion disable response time (B)

During this component of the safe braking model (labeled B in Figure D.1), the train continues to accelerate until the train propulsion system has been disabled in response to the CBTC system initiating an emergency brake application.

# D.4 Coast time (C)

During this component of the safe braking model (labeled C in Figure D.1), the train is assumed to be coasting at the maximum speed achieved as a result of the train accelerating prior to propulsion being disabled. This component of the safe braking model ends when emergency braking begins to take effect.

# D.5 Emergency brake build-up time (D)

During this component of the safe braking model (labeled D in Figure D.1), the emergency brake rate will build up from zero to at least the GEBR.

# D.6 Emergency braking at GEBR (E)

During this component of the safe braking model (labeled E in Figure D.1), the train continues to decelerate at the GEBR until the train comes to zero speed.

Note—The components D and E may be integrated into an equivalent single brake curve.

# D.7 Position uncertainty

The safe braking model must include the maximum distance due to measurement inaccuracy by the CBTC system for both the leading and following train.

# E.6 Risk assessment

The hazard resolution process shall be initiated by defining the physical and functional characteristics of the system to be analyzed. These characteristics shall be presented in terms of the major elements that make up the system and its environment, including equipment, facilities, procedures, and people.

The hazards shall be identified. The techniques and methods used to identify the hazards shall include the following:

Risk assessment estimates (see Table E.1) shall be used as the basis in the decision-making process to determine whether individual system or subsystem hazards shall be eliminated, mitigated, or accepted. Hazards shall be resolved through a design process that emphasizes the elimination of the hazard. Resolution strategies or countermeasures to be employed, listed in order of decreasing preference, shall be the following:

7) Eliminate the system/subsystem/equipment

This process shall include full documentation of the hazard resolution activities. The effectiveness of the countermeasures shall be monitored to determine that no new hazards are introduced. In addition, whenever substantive changes are made to the system, analyses shall be conducted to identify and resolve any new hazards.

Table E.1 provides an example of the relationship between risk, severity, and probability as it may be applied when assessing CBTC systems. The authority having jurisdiction may choose to modify this table to reflect existing procedures or requirements.

# Residual risk levels

Unacceptable (1A/B/C/D, 2A/B/C/D, and 3A)

CBTC systems with residual risks rated at this level are considered unacceptable; hazards must be mitigated through fail-safe designs.

Undesirable (1E, 2E, 3B, and 4A)

CBTC systems with residual risks rated at this level are considered undesirable; depending on economic and functional requirements, CBTC systems with hazards rated at this risk level may be considered acceptable with explicit agreement from the authority having jurisdiction.

Acceptable with review (3C/D and 4B/C)

CBTC systems with residual risks rated at this level are considered acceptable with review; depending on economic and functional requirements, CBTC systems with hazards rated at this risk level may be considered acceptable with notification to the authority having jurisdiction.

Acceptable without review (3E and 4D/E)

CBTC systems with residual risks rated at this level are considered acceptable without review; additional design effort or system revision is not required to reduce the severity or probability of hazards with this risk level.

# Frequency of occurrence

A—Frequent = Likely to occur frequently; MTBHE is less than 1000 operating hours.

B—Probable = Will occur several times in the life of an item; MTBHE is equal to or greater than 1000 operating hours and less than 100 000 operating hours.

E—Improbable = So unlikely, it can be assumed occurrence may not be experienced; MTBHE is equal to or greater than 1000000000 operating hours.

# Hazard severity

1—Catastrophic = Fatality, system loss, or severe environmental damage.

2—Critical = Severe injury, severe occupational illness, major system or environmental damage.

# Annex F

(informative)

# Typical approaches to specifying CBTC system availability

# F.1 Traditional equipment-based approach

The traditional approach to defining system availability is the probability that the system is capable of operating and performing its intended function at a random point in time, as determined by the system MTBFF and MTTRS, as shown in Equation (F.1):

$$
\text {C B T C} = \text {s y s t e m M T B F F} / (\text {s y s t e m M T B F F} + \text {s y s t e m M T T R S}) \tag {F.1}
$$

where

System MTTRS is the sum of the system MTTR and the mean travel times for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure.

With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:

a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements  
b) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure  
c) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirement  
d) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system MTBFF

For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined analytically from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs.

Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service system MTBFF and MTTRS, with appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of the CBTC system.

# F.2 Alternative delayed trip-based approach

An alternative approach is to define CBTC system availability in terms of the system's contributions to the desired on-time performance of the transit system, as shown in Equation (F.2):

$$
\text {C B T C} = \frac {1 - \Sigma w _ {x} \text {R e v e n u e t r i p s d e l a y e d m o r e t h a n} t _ {x} \text {b y C B T C T y p e f a i l u r e}}{\text {T o t a l s c h u r e d r e v e n u e t r i p s}} \tag {F.2}
$$

where

Revenue trip is a scheduled movement of a train, of defined length, from a point of origin to a destination,  $t_x$  is a defined delay threshold,

$w_{\chi}$  is a weighting factor associated with that delay threshold.

With this approach, CBTC system availability would take into account the delays experienced by passengers. As the passenger judges transit system availability on the basis of the wait and travel time variations of the service provided, CBTC system failures that result in longer delays are penalized with a

greater weighting factor than failures that result in shorter delays. In general, delay thresholds would be related to the operating headways, as delays at shorter headways impact on-time performance more significantly.

The CBTC system availability requirement may also consider other failure types, to the extent that such failures impact fleet availability. For example, even if a train-borne CBTC equipment failure does not immediately impact the on-time performance of the transit system, it may subsequently result in missed revenue trips if the failure repair time results in the train being unavailable for service.

With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:

a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements  
b) The various delay thresholds and weighting factors  
c) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure  
d) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirements  
e) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system availability

For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined through computer modeling from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs, and an assumed system operating plan.

Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service delays, with appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of the CBTC system.
